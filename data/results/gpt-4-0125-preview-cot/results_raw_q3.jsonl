Both behaviors are widely observed and relatable, as most people have encountered individuals who exhibit one or both traits in various social and professional settings. The first part of the statement addresses the tendency to self-censor, which can stem from social pressures, fear of judgment, or personal insecurities.

This idea aligns with the common psychological phenomenon known as the negativity bias, where negative experiences have a greater impact on one's psychological state and processes than neutral or positive experiences. In practical terms, it means that a person's few negative actions or traits can heavily influence others' perception of them, often more so than their many good actions or traits. This can be seen in various areas of life, such as personal relationships, professional settings, and public reputations.\n\nGiven that this concept is supported by psychological research and can be observed in everyday life, it can be considered a matter of common sense as it aligns with general human experiences and perceptions.

This can be a common observation as people who do not prioritize their own tasks might end up being unproductive and may fail to achieve personal success or growth. Focusing on other people's business can be a distraction and a way to avoid dealing with one's own issues. Therefore, the statement can be seen as common sense because it highlights the importance of self-awareness and personal responsibility.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 32, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"A fracking ban should not be implemented.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"A fracking ban should not be implemented\" is a matter of opinion and depends on various factors including environmental, economic, and social considerations.

Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"A great boss would not make employees work overtime without compensation\" is based on the idea of fairness and respect for employees' time and effort. Ethically, it makes sense for a boss to compensate employees for any additional hours worked beyond their regular schedule. Fair compensation for overtime is also supported by labor laws in many countries, which require employers to pay employees extra for overtime hours. Therefore, considering these ethical and legal perspectives, it seems reasonable to expect a great boss to adhere to these practices.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 46, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"A gregarious person doesn't want to be alone.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"A gregarious person doesn't want to be alone\" is based on the definition of the word \"gregarious,\" which refers to a person who is sociable, outgoing, and enjoys the company of others. By nature, a gregarious person tends to seek out social interactions and feels more comfortable and happy in the presence of others rather than being alone. Therefore, it is logical to conclude that a gregarious person generally prefers not to be alone, aligning with their sociable characteristics. So the answer is yes."}

Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that a happy marriage involves continuous and enjoyable communication between partners, which makes time seem to pass quickly. This aligns with the idea that strong communication is a key component of a successful and fulfilling relationship. Partners who can engage in open, honest, and meaningful conversations are likely to feel more connected and satisfied with their relationship. The metaphor of a \"long conversation\" emphasizes the importance of ongoing communication throughout the duration of the marriage. Since effective communication is commonly recognized as essential for maintaining a healthy relationship, the statement resonates with general wisdom about successful partnerships. \n\nSo the answer is yes."}

Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement implies that love, like digestion, is a natural and involuntary process that cannot be influenced by external persuasion. This aligns with the common understanding that emotions, such as love, arise spontaneously and cannot be controlled or dictated by sheer will or coercion. Similarly, digestion is an automatic physiological process that occurs without conscious effort. Both processes require certain internal conditions to occur naturally, rather than being driven by external persuasion.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}

{"id": 50, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"A hidden connection is stronger than an obvious one.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"A hidden connection is stronger than an obvious one\" speaks to the idea that connections that aren't immediately apparent can have a more profound and significant impact. This could be because hidden connections often require deeper exploration and understanding, leading to a stronger bond or impact. Additionally, hidden connections might not be subjected to external scrutiny or influence, allowing them to develop more organically and authentically. However, whether this statement is common sense depends on the context and the nature of the connections being referred to. In some cases, obvious connections can also be strong and meaningful.

Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that a husband's role includes giving feedback on his wife's appearance, specifically regarding her lipstick. However, it's important to recognize that relationships and dynamics vary widely between couples. In some relationships, partners may appreciate and seek out feedback on their appearance from each other, while in others, they may not. Additionally, the idea that it's specifically the husband's role to comment on lipstick may reinforce traditional gender roles and stereotypes. Therefore, whether this statement is considered common sense can depend on individual perspectives and relationship dynamics.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 53, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"A lawyer s opinion is worth nothing until paid for.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement, \"A lawyer's opinion is worth nothing until paid for,\" implies that the value of a lawyer's advice or opinion is contingent upon monetary compensation. This perspective overlooks the intrinsic value of professional expertise and ethical responsibility that lawyers uphold regardless of payment. Legal advice can be valuable and impactful even if it is given pro bono or before payment is made. It also diminishes the importance of trust and the fiduciary duty that lawyers have towards their clients.\n\nFurthermore, legal opinions can carry significant weight in decision-making processes, shaping outcomes in critical situations. The worth of such opinions should not be solely determined by financial transactions, but rather by the quality, accuracy, and relevance of the advice provided.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 54, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"A life of leisure is a kingdom with less care than a kingdom requires.\" Do you think this statement is common sense?

It suggests that a life focused on relaxation and enjoyment is inherently less stressful than one filled with the duties of leadership and governance.\n\nThis perspective aligns with common sense, as most people would agree that having fewer responsibilities generally leads to less stress and worry. Managing a kingdom or any other form of leadership role entails a wide array of tasks and pressures that a leisurely life simply does not have.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 55, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"A loving heart maintains a family a hateful heart destroys it.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"A loving heart maintains a family, a hateful heart destroys it\" reflects the idea that positive emotions and attitudes, such as love, foster healthy and supportive relationships within a family unit, while negative emotions, such as hate, lead to conflict and disintegration. Love encourages understanding, compassion, and cooperation, which are essential for maintaining strong family bonds. On the other hand, hate breeds resentment, anger, and disconnection, which can tear a family apart. Therefore, the statement aligns with the intuitive understanding of how emotions impact relationships. So the answer is yes."}

However, in a literal sense, it does not align with reality or practical understanding. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 58, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"A man has one hundred dollars and you leave him with two dollars that`s subtraction.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"A man has one hundred dollars and you leave him with two dollars, that's subtraction\" suggests that the man originally had one hundred dollars, and then was left with only two dollars. This indicates that ninety-eight dollars were taken away or deducted from the original amount. Subtraction is the mathematical operation used to find the difference between two numbers, so this scenario is an example of subtraction.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 59, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"A man in love is not complete until he is married then he is finished.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"A man in love is not complete until he is married then he is finished\" is a humorous play on words that suggests marriage is the endpoint of a man's journey in love. However, this perspective may not hold true for everyone, as relationships and personal fulfillment are subjective and vary from person to person. Marriage does not necessarily complete an individual, nor does it signify an end. Instead, it marks a new chapter in a person's life, filled with shared experiences and growth. Thus, the statement may not align with everyone's experiences or beliefs about love and marriage. \n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 60, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"A man is a success if he gets up in the morning and goes to bed at night and in between does what he wants to do.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement implies that success is defined by the ability to do what one wants throughout the day. This perspective emphasizes personal fulfillment and autonomy as key measures of success. However, this definition may not encompass other important aspects such as achieving goals, contributing to society, or providing for oneself and others. It also assumes that everyone has the freedom and resources to spend their day as they please, which may not be the case for everyone. Therefore, while the statement may resonate with some, it does not provide a comprehensive definition of success that applies universally.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 61, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"A man is not old as long as he is seeking something.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that a sense of purpose or pursuit keeps a person youthful in spirit, regardless of their physical age. This aligns with psychological theories that emphasize the importance of continued growth, learning, and engagement in activities as key factors in maintaining mental and emotional well-being as people age. The idea is that seeking goals and striving for something can contribute to a more fulfilling and vibrant life, which can in turn combat feelings of aging and stagnation. So the answer is yes."}

Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"A man loves his sweetheart the most, his wife the best, but his mother the longest\" suggests that a man's love for different important women in his life varies in intensity, quality, and duration. This could be interpreted as common sense in the sense that it reflects traditional societal views on the different roles women play in a man's life: a sweetheart is associated with passion, a wife with deep companionship and commitment, and a mother with lifelong nurturing and care. However, the statement is an oversimplification and doesn't account for individual differences in relationships, personal experiences, or the changing dynamics of love over time. It also reinforces gender stereotypes and traditional roles which might not apply universally. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 63, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"A man should be taller older heavier uglier and hoarser than his wife.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"A man should be taller, older, heavier, uglier, and hoarser than his wife\" reflects traditional gender stereotypes and societal expectations, rather than common sense. Common sense suggests that relationships should be built on mutual respect, compatibility, and shared values, rather than on superficial physical characteristics or age differences. In modern society, the emphasis is increasingly on equality and personal preferences in relationships, rather than conforming to rigid norms. Therefore, the idea that one partner should fit a specific physical or age-related mold in relation to the other is outdated and not aligned with common sense.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 64, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"A man who pays respect to the great paves the way for his own greatness.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"A man who pays respect to the great paves the way for his own greatness\" suggests that showing respect and admiration for accomplished individuals can lead to personal growth and success. This idea aligns with the principles of humility, learning, and networking. By respecting those who have achieved greatness, a person can learn from their experiences, gain valuable insights, and potentially foster relationships that can aid in their own journey towards success. It also reflects a positive character trait that is often admired and reciprocated by others. Therefore, the statement is grounded in common sense as it emphasizes the importance of respect and learning from others as a pathway to personal achievement. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 65, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"A man with no legs cannot run.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"A man with no legs cannot run\" is based on the traditional understanding of running, which involves using one's legs to propel oneself forward in a swift motion. Without legs, it would be physically impossible to perform the action of running as it is commonly understood. While there are prosthetic devices and other aids that can help someone without legs to move quickly, the action would not be considered running in the conventional sense. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 66, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"A man without a trade is like a tree without fruit.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that just as a tree's primary purpose is to bear fruit, a man's primary purpose is to have a trade or skill that allows him to be productive and contribute to society. It implies that without a trade, a man may lack purpose, direction, or the means to support himself, similar to how a fruitless tree may be seen as less valuable or fulfilling its potential. This analogy emphasizes the importance of having a skill or trade in achieving a meaningful and self-sufficient life.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 67, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"A man`s true character comes out when he`s drunk.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"A man's true character comes out when he's drunk\" is based on the idea that alcohol lowers inhibitions and self-control, potentially leading to a more unfiltered expression of one's personality and behavior. However, it's important to note that alcohol can also impair judgment, distort thinking, and lead to behavior that may not reflect a person's typical character or values when sober. Additionally, people can react differently to alcohol, and their behavior while intoxicated may not be consistent or indicative of their true character. Therefore, it is overly simplistic and not entirely accurate to assume that drunken behavior always reveals a person's true character. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 68, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"A man`s true secrets are more secret to himself than they are to others.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that individuals may not be fully aware of their own motivations, desires, or thoughts, and that others may be able to perceive these aspects more clearly. This aligns with psychological concepts such as the unconscious mind, where certain thoughts and feelings are not accessible to the individual's conscious awareness. It also reflects the idea that others can sometimes observe patterns or traits in a person's behavior that the person themselves may not recognize. However, whether others truly have a deeper understanding of an individual's secrets than the individual themselves is subjective and may vary depending on the situation and the individuals involved.\n\nSo the answer is no."}

Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"A nation may lose its liberties in a day and not miss them in a century\" suggests that a significant loss of freedoms can happen suddenly, but the realization and impact of that loss may not be felt or understood by the citizens for a long time. This could be due to gradual adaptation to the new norm, suppression of dissent, or lack of awareness about the lost liberties. History has examples where rights and freedoms were eroded quickly, and the public either did not notice immediately or became accustomed to the new way of life over time. Thus, the statement points to the potential dangers of complacency and the importance of vigilance in protecting democratic freedoms.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 70, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"A need for information would make you want to go on the internet.\" Do you think this statement is common sense?

Money is a fundamental medium of exchange in most societies, and earning a living is often the primary method individuals use to acquire the money they need. Therefore, when there is a need for money, it naturally drives individuals to seek ways to earn it, whether through employment, entrepreneurship, or other means. The connection between the need for money and the motivation to earn a living is widely understood and generally aligns with common sense reasoning about human behavior and economic necessity.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}

Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"A nickname is the hardest stone that the devil can throw at a man\" suggests that a nickname can be a significant source of harm or distress. This could be interpreted as common sense in the sense that nicknames, especially derogatory or hurtful ones, can have a lasting emotional impact on an individual. It can affect a person's self-esteem and how they are perceived by others. Being labeled by a nickname, especially a negative one, can feel like an attack on one's identity and character, which can be hard to shake off or overcome.

{"id": 74, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"A number raised to another number is generally higher than the addition of those two numbers.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "To evaluate the statement, we can consider specific examples of numbers raised to the power of another number and compare the result to the sum of those two numbers. \n\nFor instance, if we take 2 raised to the power of 3, we get 2^3 = 8. The sum of the numbers 2 and 3 is 5. Comparing these, 8 is indeed greater than 5.\n\nSimilarly, for larger numbers, say 3 raised to the power of 4, we get 3^4 = 81. The sum of the numbers 3 and 4 is 7. Again, 81 is significantly larger than 7.\n\nFrom these examples, it seems that a number raised to the power of another number generally results in a value that is greater than the sum of those two numbers, especially as the numbers increase. This is because exponential growth increases much faster than linear growth.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 75, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"A one and a one make an eleven.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"A one and a one make an eleven\" is not common sense when taken literally in a mathematical context, as the sum of one and one is two, not eleven. However, if interpreted figuratively where the digits are placed side by side, \"1\" and \"1\" can visually appear as \"11\", which is eleven. It depends on the interpretation and context in which the statement is used. Despite the potential for figurative interpretation, the statement does not align with conventional mathematical logic or common sense. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 76, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"A part of kindness consists in loving people more than they deserve.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that true kindness involves extending love and compassion beyond what may seem warranted based on someone's actions or behavior. This notion aligns with the idea that kindness is a selfless and unconditional act, not contingent on what one may receive in return. By loving people more than they may deserve, we are practicing empathy, understanding, and forgiveness\u2014key components of kindness.

{"id": 130, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"A person with a high fever is likely to be healthy.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "A high fever typically indicates that the body is fighting off an infection or illness, suggesting that the person is not currently in a state of good health. Fevers are a symptom of an underlying issue and are generally not associated with being healthy. Therefore, the statement that a person with a high fever is likely to be healthy contradicts the general understanding of what a fever represents in terms of health.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 131, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"A person's race is not relevant to their abilities.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"A person's race is not relevant to their abilities\" is grounded in the understanding that abilities stem from a combination of individual talent, effort, education, and experience, rather than from inherent racial characteristics. Race is a social construct and does not determine an individual's capacity to develop skills or achieve success in various endeavors. This perspective promotes equality and recognizes the diverse potential in all human beings regardless of their racial background. Therefore, evaluating someone's abilities based on their race is both illogical and unjust.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 132, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"A pessimist is one who has been intimately acquainted with an optimist.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that a pessimist's outlook on life is shaped by their interactions with an optimist, possibly because the optimist's hopeful perspective highlights the pessimist's negative viewpoint. However, a person's outlook on life can be influenced by various factors such as personal experiences, environment, and inherent personality traits, not solely by their relationship with someone of an opposing perspective. Therefore, it is not necessarily common sense to assume that a pessimist is only formed through interactions with an optimist. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 133, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"A point of view has different perspectives.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"A point of view has different perspectives\" suggests that a single viewpoint can be seen and understood in various ways by different people. This is a reflection of the subjective nature of human perception and interpretation. Each individual's background, experiences, and biases influence how they perceive and interpret a particular point of view. As a result, a single point of view can yield multiple perspectives, each shaped by the unique lens through which it is viewed.\n\nThis idea aligns with the common understanding that people can have differing opinions and interpretations about the same topic or event. It acknowledges the diversity of human thought and the complexity of individual perception.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 134, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"A political man can have as his aim the realization of freedom but he has no means to realize it other than through violence.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement that a political man can only realize freedom through violence is a contentious one. It assumes that violence is the sole method for achieving political change or freedom, which overlooks the potential of diplomacy, dialogue, and peaceful protest. Throughout history, there have been numerous instances where non-violent movements have successfully brought about significant political and social change. Examples include the Civil Rights Movement in the United States and the Indian independence movement led by Mahatma Gandhi. These movements show that it is possible to achieve freedom and political goals through non-violent means. Therefore, the statement oversimplifies the complex nature of political change and the diverse strategies that can be employed to achieve it. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 135, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"A politician campaigning for the city council has to have experience working in the city.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"A politician campaigning for the city council has to have experience working in the city\" suggests that having prior experience in the city's operations or community involvement would be beneficial for a city council candidate. This experience could provide the candidate with a deeper understanding of the city's issues, challenges, and strengths, enabling them to make more informed decisions and better represent the constituents. However, it's not necessarily a requirement, as new perspectives and fresh ideas from individuals without direct experience in the city could also be valuable. Nevertheless, having experience could be seen as an advantage in understanding the specific context of the city.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 136, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"A really busy person never knows how much he weighs.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement, \"A really busy person never knows how much he weighs,\" implies that individuals who are preoccupied with numerous tasks and responsibilities do not have the time or attention to monitor their weight. However, being busy does not necessarily prevent someone from keeping track of their weight. Many busy individuals maintain awareness of their health, including their weight, by integrating regular check-ups or using digital scales that require minimal time and effort. Being busy and being aware of one's weight are not mutually exclusive. Therefore, the statement is an overgeneralization and does not hold as a common-sense truth for everyone. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 137, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"A refusal of praise is a desire to be praised twice.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that when someone refuses praise, they may be doing so in an attempt to elicit additional praise. The reasoning is that by initially refusing praise, the individual may appear humble or modest, which could lead to others praising them even more for their humility or further emphasizing their initial praise. However, whether this statement is common sense depends on one's perspective on human behavior and motives. Some may see it as a cynical view, while others may recognize it as a common social tactic.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 138, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"A sane person to an insane society must appear insane.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that when a rational individual is surrounded by irrational or dysfunctional societal norms, their reasonable behavior may be perceived as abnormal or irrational by others within that society. This is because the majority's perception of normalcy is skewed by the prevailing norms, regardless of how irrational they may be. Therefore, the sane person's actions, which deviate from the societal norm, could be misinterpreted as insane. This idea aligns with the concept that the perception of sanity is relative and can be influenced by the context or environment. \n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 139, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"A ship in port is safe but that is not what ships are for.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"A ship in port is safe but that is not what ships are for\" suggests that while being in a safe or comfortable position might be secure, it is not fulfilling the intended purpose. Ships are designed and built to sail, explore, transport goods, and face the open sea. The analogy can be applied to individuals or organizations as well, emphasizing the importance of taking risks and venturing beyond comfort zones to achieve growth and fulfill potential. It encourages embracing challenges and opportunities rather than remaining stagnant in a secure but unproductive state. Therefore, the statement can be seen as a reminder of the value of taking action and striving towards one's purpose despite potential risks.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 140, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"A simple way of finding whether a gun is stolen is too look at its serial number.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that checking the serial number of a gun is a simple method to determine if it is stolen. This is based on the assumption that a stolen gun would likely have its serial number registered in a database of stolen items, which law enforcement or other relevant authorities could access. However, the simplicity of this process depends on various factors, such as the accessibility of such databases to the person checking the gun, and whether the serial number has been tampered with or removed by the thief. Without access to the right resources or encountering altered serial numbers, this method may not be straightforward for everyone. \n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 141, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"A smile is usually perceived as a positive emotion.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"A smile is usually perceived as a positive emotion\" is generally considered common sense because a smile is widely recognized as a universal expression of happiness, friendliness, or contentment. Across different cultures and societies, smiling is often associated with positive emotions and experiences, making it a common indicator of goodwill and approachability. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that the perception of a smile as a positive emotion is a widely accepted notion. So the answer is yes."}

The statement highlights the value of leaving a positive legacy, which can be seen as a wise and admirable approach to life and community-building.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 143, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"A square has 4 sides.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"A square has 4 sides\" is a basic geometric fact that is universally accepted and understood. A square is defined as a two-dimensional shape with four equal sides and four right angles. This definition is taught early in education and is a fundamental concept in geometry. Therefore, it can be considered common knowledge or common sense for anyone familiar with basic shapes.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 144, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"A strong wind would make you want to fly a kite.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"A strong wind would make you want to fly a kite\" is based on the idea that kites rely on wind to become airborne and stay in the air. With a strong wind, the kite can catch more air and fly higher and more steadily. Therefore, it is common sense that a strong wind would be ideal for kite flying and could make someone more inclined to engage in that activity. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 145, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"A sword is sharp.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"A sword is sharp\" is generally considered common sense because swords are designed and crafted with the purpose of having a sharp edge for cutting or piercing. The sharpness of a sword is a fundamental characteristic that enables it to function effectively as a weapon. It is widely recognized and understood that swords are intended to be sharp to serve their purpose in combat or other uses.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}

{"id": 147, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"A teacher who is not dogmatic is simply a teacher who is not teaching.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"A teacher who is not dogmatic is simply a teacher who is not teaching\" implies that effective teaching requires imposing a fixed set of beliefs or doctrines on students. However, teaching can be most effective when it encourages critical thinking, exploration, and open-mindedness rather than strictly adhering to dogmatic principles. A non-dogmatic teacher can facilitate learning by presenting multiple perspectives and encouraging students to form their own informed opinions. Therefore, it is not necessary for a teacher to be dogmatic in order to teach effectively.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 148, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"A theist is the opposite of an atheist.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "A theist is someone who believes in the existence of a god or gods, whereas an atheist is someone who does not believe in the existence of a god or gods. Given that the core beliefs of theism and atheism are diametrically opposed, it could be argued that the two positions are opposites in terms of belief in a deity. However, it's important to note that there are various degrees and nuances within both theism and atheism, and other categories such as agnosticism also exist which neither affirm nor deny the existence of a god. Therefore, while the statement may hold true in a general sense regarding belief in a deity, it does not capture the full spectrum of beliefs about the existence of a god. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 149, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"A theory is not a fact.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"A theory is not a fact\" reflects a common misunderstanding of scientific terminology. In everyday language, a \"theory\" might imply a guess or hypothesis, but in scientific terms, a theory is a well-substantiated explanation of some aspect of the natural world, based on a body of facts that have been repeatedly confirmed through observation and experimentation. A scientific theory is not just a simple fact, but rather a complex framework that explains a range of facts and observations. So the statement oversimplifies the relationship between theories and facts in the context of science. However, in a broader, non-scientific context, the statement could be seen as making a basic distinction between an idea (theory) and an observed reality (fact). Thus, whether the statement is seen as common sense can depend on the context in which it is used.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 150, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"A war is not won if the defeated enemy has not been turned into a friend.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"A war is not won if the defeated enemy has not been turned into a friend\" suggests that true victory in war goes beyond just defeating the enemy militarily, and extends to building positive relationships and reconciliation post-conflict. This idea highlights the importance of sustainable peace and preventing future conflicts. This perspective is not necessarily common sense as it goes beyond the traditional notion of victory through overpowering the enemy, and instead emphasizes the need for diplomacy, understanding, and cooperation after the conflict is over. Therefore, this statement represents a more nuanced understanding of what it means to win a war.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 151, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"A wet sponge will soak up more water than a dry sponge.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"A wet sponge will soak up more water than a dry sponge\" may initially seem counterintuitive, as one might assume that a dry sponge, having more available capacity, would absorb more water. However, when considering the properties of a sponge, a wet sponge already has its pores partially filled with water, which reduces the surface tension and allows it to more easily soak up additional water compared to a dry sponge, whose dry pores may resist water entry initially. Therefore, understanding the underlying mechanism makes it clear that a wet sponge would indeed be more efficient at soaking up water.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 152, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"A wise man in his house should find a wife gentle and courteous or no wife at all.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that a wise man should seek a spouse who is gentle and courteous, and if such qualities are not present, it is better not to marry at all. This can be seen as promoting the idea that mutual respect and kindness are foundational in a successful and harmonious marital relationship. This perspective aligns with common sense as it emphasizes the importance of positive interpersonal qualities that contribute to a healthy and supportive partnership.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 153, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"A wise man proportions his believes to the evidence.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement, \"A wise man proportions his beliefs to the evidence,\" suggests that it is prudent to base one's beliefs on the amount and quality of evidence available. This approach aligns with critical thinking and rational decision-making, as it encourages individuals to evaluate information objectively before forming conclusions. It helps to prevent the formation of beliefs based on assumptions, biases, or insufficient information, which can lead to errors in judgment. This principle is commonly accepted in various fields such as science, law, and everyday decision-making, indicating its practicality and sensibility. Therefore, it can be considered a common-sense approach to forming beliefs.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 154, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"A year from now you may wish you had started today.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement, \"A year from now you may wish you had started today,\" suggests that taking action now can prevent future regret over missed opportunities or delayed progress. This idea is a common motivational concept that encourages proactive behavior. It aligns with the principle that timely effort can lead to positive outcomes and reduce the likelihood of looking back with regret over inaction. Therefore, it can be considered common sense to acknowledge the value of starting sooner rather than later to achieve goals.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}

Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that continuously engaging in avoidant behavior reinforces and strengthens that behavior, making it more likely to persist over time. This idea is rooted in the psychological principle of reinforcement, where behaviors that are practiced and repeated become more ingrained and habitual. Avoiding challenges or difficult situations might provide temporary relief or comfort, but it ultimately prevents personal growth and the development of effective coping strategies. Therefore, the statement emphasizes the negative consequences of not confronting and addressing avoidant behavior. \n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 156, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"Ability to think like the violin or piano requires daily practice.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that developing a deep understanding and proficiency in an instrument, such as the violin or piano, requires daily practice. This aligns with the general understanding that mastering any skill, especially complex instruments, involves consistent and dedicated practice to hone one's abilities and think intuitively in terms of the instrument's mechanics and musical expression. Therefore, the statement reflects a common sense approach to skill acquisition and expertise in music. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 157, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"Abolish the police is an extreme stance taken by democrats.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"Abolish the police is an extreme stance taken by democrats\" is an oversimplification and does not accurately represent the views of all Democrats. While there are some individuals and groups within the Democratic Party who advocate for defunding or abolishing the police, this is not a universally held stance among all Democrats. Many Democrats support police reform measures rather than complete abolition. Additionally, the idea of police abolition is also supported by individuals outside of the Democratic Party, including some independents and members of other political parties. Therefore, it is not accurate to characterize police abolition as an extreme stance taken solely by Democrats.\n\nSo the answer is no."}

Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"Abortion is a crime because life begins with conception\" is not necessarily common sense, as it is based on specific moral, ethical, and scientific interpretations that vary widely among individuals and cultures. The definition of when life begins is a deeply contested issue, with differing views among scientists, religious groups, and legal systems. Additionally, whether abortion should be considered a crime depends on legal statutes which also differ by jurisdiction. Therefore, the statement reflects a particular viewpoint and is not universally accepted or self-evident as common sense might suggest. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 159, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"Access to healthcare and education should be a priority.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "Many would argue that access to healthcare and education is fundamental for the well-being and development of individuals and societies. Healthcare ensures that people are physically able to lead productive lives and education equips individuals with the knowledge and skills needed to contribute effectively to society and the economy. Both are also considered human rights according to international declarations. Prioritizing access to healthcare and education can lead to a healthier, more educated population which in turn can drive economic growth, reduce poverty, and promote social stability. Therefore, it is logical to consider this statement as common sense. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 160, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"Access to healthcare should be available for all without worry of debt.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"Access to healthcare should be available for all without worry of debt\" reflects a belief in healthcare as a fundamental human right.

Ensuring access to healthcare without financial barriers can lead to a healthier population, reduce the spread of diseases, and enhance overall quality of life. Many developed countries have systems in place to provide universal healthcare coverage to alleviate the burden of medical expenses on their citizens. Therefore, the statement aligns with principles of equity and public health.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 161, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"Acquaintance a person whom we know well enough to borrow from but not well enough to lend to.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that an acquaintance is someone with whom we have a certain level of trust and familiarity, but not enough to engage in reciprocal financial transactions. It implies that we might trust them to a certain extent, but not enough to risk our own resources. This reflects a cautious approach to financial dealings with people who are not close friends or family members. Given that lending money can complicate relationships and carries the risk of not being repaid, the statement can be seen as a practical guideline for managing financial interactions with acquaintances. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 162, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"Act that we want to pass this session is prohibiting arrests for nonjailable.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"Act that we want to pass this session is prohibiting arrests for non-jailable offenses\" suggests that arrests should not be made for minor offenses that do not warrant jail time. This approach could potentially prevent unnecessary use of law enforcement resources on minor offenses and reduce overcrowding in jails. It also aligns with the principle of proportionality in the criminal justice system, ensuring that the severity of the response (arrest and detention) matches the severity of the offense.\n\nHowever, the practical implementation and implications of such a policy would need to be carefully considered. For example, it would be important to clearly define what constitutes a \"non-jailable\" offense and ensure that there are still appropriate consequences and interventions in place to address such offenses.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 163, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"Add two numbers together will create a bigger number.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"Add two numbers together will create a bigger number\" seems to imply that adding any two numbers will always result in a larger number. However, this is not always true. For example, if you add a positive number and a negative number, the result could be smaller, larger, or the same, depending on the values of the numbers. Additionally, adding zero to any number will result in the same number, not a bigger one. Therefore, the statement is not universally true. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 164, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"Admiration and familiarity are strangers.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"Admiration and familiarity are strangers\" suggests that the more familiar we become with something or someone, the less we may admire it or them. This could be interpreted as the idea that admiration is often based on a sense of mystique or novelty, which can diminish with increased familiarity. However, this isn't always the case as familiarity can also lead to a deeper understanding and appreciation, thereby increasing admiration. Therefore, whether this statement is common sense or not can depend on the context and the nature of the relationship or subject in question. In some cases, increased familiarity might reduce admiration, while in others it might enhance it. So the answer is no."}

Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement implies that facing challenges and difficulties allows a person to truly understand and test their moral values and honesty. It suggests that without adversity, a person's principles may remain unexamined and unproven. This idea is based on the understanding that it is often in difficult situations where one's true character is revealed, as it is when we are tested that we must decide whether to uphold our values or compromise them for an easier path. This perspective is a common one in discussions about moral integrity and personal growth.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 169, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"Advise and counsel him if he does not listen let adversity teach him.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that if someone does not heed advice or counsel, they may learn through experiencing difficulties or challenges. This idea aligns with the concept that consequences can serve as a teacher when other forms of guidance are ignored. It underscores the notion that personal growth and understanding can occur through facing hardships, which is a common perspective in many cultures and philosophies. Therefore, the statement reflects a practical approach to dealing with situations where individuals are resistant to advice.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}

{"id": 171, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"Africa is a continent.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"Africa is a continent\" is widely recognized and accepted based on geographical definitions and classifications. Africa is one of the seven continents on Earth, known for its distinct geographical boundaries and diverse cultures, languages, and ecosystems. This information is commonly taught in educational systems around the world and is a basic fact in geography. Therefore, it is considered common sense as it is general knowledge that is easily accessible and broadly understood. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 172, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"After a certain point money is meaningless it ceases to be the goal the game is what counts.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that beyond a certain level of wealth, the accumulation of money loses its significance and the pursuit of other goals or challenges becomes more important. This idea aligns with the concept that once basic needs and financial security are met, people may seek fulfillment and purpose in other areas of life that money cannot buy, such as personal growth, relationships, and experiences. This perspective is supported by research in psychology and economics that indicates that after reaching a certain level of income, additional money has diminishing returns on overall happiness and well-being. Therefore, the statement reflects a common understanding of human motivation and the limits of material wealth as a source of satisfaction.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 173, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"After a trial one party is naked and the other without shirt.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"After a trial one party is naked and the other without shirt\" appears to be a metaphorical expression rather than a literal observation. It suggests that after a trial, both parties may suffer losses or be left in a worse condition than they began, though to varying degrees. The imagery of one party being \"naked\" and the other \"without shirt\" implies that one party may have lost more than the other, but both are negatively affected.\n\nThis statement can be seen as reflecting the idea that legal battles or conflicts often result in significant costs\u2014financial, emotional, or reputational\u2014for all involved, regardless of the outcome. It highlights the potentially destructive nature of disputes and suggests that engaging in them might lead to pyrrhic victories or mutual detriment.\n\nGiven this interpretation, it seems that the statement is invoking a perspective on the consequences of contentious situations, which could be considered a type of common sense in cautioning against unnecessary conflicts.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 174, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"Airlines can ban emotional support animals because of their misbehavior and pet owners skirting airline rules and fees.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that airlines have the authority to ban emotional support animals due to their misbehavior and pet owners trying to avoid airline rules and fees. Airlines are responsible for ensuring the safety and comfort of all passengers, and misbehaving animals can disrupt the travel experience. Additionally, pet owners who skirt rules and fees create an unfair situation and potentially increase costs for the airline. Therefore, it is reasonable for airlines to implement bans or restrictions to address these issues and maintain order.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 175, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"Alcohol should be restricted for fans during sport games.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"Alcohol should be restricted for fans during sport games\" is often considered common sense due to several reasons. Firstly, excessive alcohol consumption can lead to disruptive behavior, which can negatively impact the experience of other fans. Secondly, intoxicated individuals are more likely to engage in fights or other aggressive actions, which can compromise safety in the venue. Lastly, limiting alcohol can also be beneficial for public health and safety, reducing incidents of drunk driving post-game.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 176, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"Alcohol would make you want to sleep at night.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "Alcohol is known to have sedative effects, which can make a person feel drowsy and more inclined to fall asleep. However, it's important to note that while alcohol may initially induce sleep, it can disrupt sleep patterns and decrease sleep quality throughout the night. Despite the potential negative impact on overall sleep quality, the initial drowsiness caused by alcohol consumption might lead some to believe that alcohol can help in falling asleep.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 177, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"Algebra uses variables.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "Algebra is a branch of mathematics that deals with symbols and the rules for manipulating these symbols. Variables are symbols that represent unknown values and are a fundamental part of algebraic equations and expressions. Using variables allows us to generalize and solve problems where specific numbers are not known. Thus, the use of variables is essential and intrinsic to algebra.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 178, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"All art is autobiographical the pearl is the oyster`s autobiography.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"All art is autobiographical; the pearl is the oyster's autobiography\" suggests that all creative works reflect the personal experiences, emotions, and perspectives of their creators. This idea aligns with the notion that artists often draw inspiration from their own lives and infuse their work with elements of their personal identity and experiences. In that sense, the statement proposes that art is inherently a reflection or expression of the self, much like a pearl is a product of the oyster's life and environment.\n\nHowever, not all art may be strictly autobiographical in a literal sense. Artists can also explore themes, stories, and perspectives outside of their direct experiences, using imagination, research, and empathy to create works that may not directly relate to their own lives. Thus, while there's a kernel of truth in the idea that art often contains elements of the self, it's an oversimplification to claim that all art is strictly autobiographical.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 179, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"All bad precedents begin as justifiable measures.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"All bad precedents begin as justifiable measures\" implies that actions or decisions that eventually lead to negative outcomes were initially considered reasonable or necessary. This can often be the case, as many decisions are made based on the information and circumstances available at the time, which can seem to warrant certain measures. However, as situations evolve and more information becomes available, these measures can create unintended consequences or set harmful precedents.\n\nFor example, in the realm of policy-making, a law intended to address a specific issue might have collateral effects that were not anticipated, leading to a \"bad precedent.\" Similarly, in business, a strategy intended to boost short-term profits might undermine long-term sustainability.\n\nWhile it is not always true that every bad precedent starts as a justifiable measure (as some are ill-conceived from the beginning), it is common for many such precedents to have originated from seemingly rational decisions made under particular circumstances. \n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 180, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"All fanatical creeds do harm they promote hatred and strife.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that fanatical creeds, which are extreme and uncompromising beliefs, inherently promote hatred and strife. This assertion can be supported by historical and contemporary examples where extreme ideologies have led to social division, conflict, and violence. When a belief system becomes fanatical, it often involves an intolerance for differing views, which can escalate into hostility and aggression. However, it is important to note that not all strong beliefs necessarily result in harm; the key issue is the fanaticism and the way the beliefs are implemented or imposed on others.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 181, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"All great deeds and all great thoughts have a ridiculous beginning great works are often born on a street corner or in a restaurant`s revolving door.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that significant achievements and ideas can originate from seemingly trivial or ordinary situations. This emphasizes the idea that inspiration and greatness can come from unexpected places and moments, regardless of the setting. It encourages us to be open to the potential of everyday situations to spark something extraordinary. This aligns with the common sense notion that great things can come from humble beginnings, and that creativity and innovation are not confined to specific environments. Therefore, the statement can be seen as a reminder that opportunities for greatness are all around us, even in the most ordinary places.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 182, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"All human beings are created equal.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"All human beings are created equal\" is a philosophical and ethical assertion that suggests that every person has the same inherent worth and rights at the moment of their creation. The concept is often associated with the idea of equal treatment under the law and equal opportunities for all. While interpretations may vary, the fundamental idea is widely accepted in many societies as a foundational principle for justice and human rights. It reflects a moral understanding that no individual should face discrimination or be regarded as inferior based on arbitrary characteristics such as race, gender, or socio-economic status.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that while the statement may represent an ideal, the practical realization of true equality among all human beings remains an ongoing challenge globally. Disparities and prejudices still exist, and achieving genuine equality requires continuous societal effort and legal frameworks to protect and promote these values.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 183, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"All kinds of beauty do not inspire love there is a kind which only pleases the sight but does not captivate the affections.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that not all forms of beauty evoke a deep emotional response or attachment, which seems reasonable. Beauty can be appreciated on a superficial level without necessarily leading to a deeper emotional connection or love. For example, one might admire a beautiful painting or a scenic landscape without feeling a desire to form an emotional bond with it. Similarly, one might find someone physically attractive but not feel a romantic attraction towards them. This distinction between aesthetic appreciation and emotional affection is a common aspect of human experience.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 184, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"All life is an experiment the more experiments you make the better.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that life should be approached with curiosity and a willingness to try new things, as each experiment provides an opportunity to learn and grow. The idea that gaining experiences can lead to better outcomes is a logical one, as it encourages adaptability, resilience, and personal development. Additionally, experimenting allows for exploration of possibilities and can lead to unexpected discoveries or solutions. Therefore, the statement aligns with the common sense notion that growth and improvement often come from actively engaging with life and learning from diverse experiences.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 185, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"All memories people call to account are made up.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"All memories people call to account are made up\" implies that every memory recalled by an individual is fabricated or imagined, rather than being a true reflection of past events. Psychological research suggests that while memory is not perfectly accurate and can be influenced by various factors, it is not entirely made up. Memories are constructed based on actual experiences, but can be subject to distortions or alterations due to biases, emotions, or new information. Thus, not all memories are entirely fabricated, although they may not be entirely accurate representations of past events either. Therefore, the statement as an absolute might not hold true.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 186, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"All our dreams can come true if we have the courage to pursue them.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"All our dreams can come true if we have the courage to pursue them\" suggests that courage and perseverance are key factors in achieving one's dreams. While these attributes can certainly help in overcoming obstacles and pushing forward towards goals, there are often external factors and circumstances beyond individual control that can impact the realization of dreams. Additionally, some dreams may be unrealistic or unattainable regardless of the amount of courage or effort put forth. Therefore, while the sentiment of the statement is motivational, it may not always hold true in reality. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 187, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"All our evil comes from our inability to be alone.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"All our evil comes from our inability to be alone\" suggests that the root of negative behavior or actions stems from a lack of comfort or capability in solitude. While it's true that isolation can lead to self-reflection and personal growth, it's an oversimplification to attribute all negative actions or \"evil\" solely to the inability to be alone. Evil can arise from various sources, including external influences, psychological factors, and situational circumstances. It is not solely dependent on one's relationship with solitude. Thus, the assertion that all evil originates from an inability to be alone does not encapsulate the complexity of human behavior and the multitude of factors that can contribute to negative actions. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 188, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"All people are human.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"All people are human\" is based on the definition of the terms involved. The word \"people\" refers to a group of human beings, and \"human\" refers to a member of the species Homo sapiens. Therefore, by definition, all people are human. This statement is a tautology, meaning it is true by necessity and does not require empirical evidence to support it. It aligns with common understanding and basic biological knowledge about human beings.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 189, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"All religions have differences.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"All religions have differences\" is common sense because it acknowledges the diversity of beliefs, practices, and traditions that exist among the various religions around the world. Each religion has its own unique set of teachings, rituals, and values that distinguish it from others. Additionally, even within a single religion, there can be different denominations or sects that have their own interpretations and customs. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that all religions have differences. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 190, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"All social movements are dismissed at some point as complaining over time they are recognized as speaking truth to power.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement implies that social movements are initially dismissed or criticized but eventually gain recognition and validation for addressing important issues. Historical examples such as the Civil Rights Movement, Women's Suffrage, and LGBTQ+ rights movements were initially met with resistance and dismissed as merely complaining. Over time, as awareness and understanding grew, these movements were recognized for their role in advocating for justice and equality, speaking truth to power. This pattern suggests a common trajectory for social movements, where initial dismissal gives way to eventual recognition of their validity and importance.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 191, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"All the continents used to be connected in one giant continent called pangea.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The concept of all continents once being connected in a supercontinent called Pangaea is based on the scientific theory of plate tectonics and geological evidence. This idea is not necessarily common knowledge or intuitive to everyone, and it requires some understanding of Earth's geological history and the movement of tectonic plates. Therefore, it might not be considered common sense to someone without a background in geology or Earth science.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 192, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"All the road's go to rome.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"All roads go to Rome\" is a metaphorical expression that means there are many different ways to reach the same goal or destination. Historically, during the Roman Empire, the road system was designed with Rome as the central hub, so most roads did lead back to Rome in a literal sense. However, in the modern world, the statement is not literally true as roads lead to various destinations all over the globe. The statement is used more figuratively to communicate the idea of multiple paths leading to a common outcome. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 193, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"All truths are easy to understand once they are discovered the point is to discover them.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"All truths are easy to understand once they are discovered; the point is to discover them\" suggests that understanding truths is straightforward once they have been uncovered, and the main challenge lies in the discovery process itself. This could be considered common sense in the context that many truths, once revealed and explained, can be comprehended without much difficulty. However, it's important to note that not all truths may be easily understandable even after being discovered, especially in complex fields such as quantum physics or abstract philosophy. Nevertheless, the essence of the statement captures a general sentiment that aligns with common sense: uncovering or discovering information is often the hardest part, and understanding follows more naturally. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 194, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"All which is not prose is verse and all which is not verse is prose.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"All which is not prose is verse and all which is not verse is prose\" implies a strict dichotomy between prose and verse, suggesting that all forms of written or spoken language must fall into one of these two categories. However, this assertion overlooks other linguistic forms like non-structured free form, visual poetry, or hybrid genres which combine elements of both prose and verse. Additionally, the statement does not account for non-linguistic forms of expression such as visual art, music, or dance, which are neither prose nor verse. Thus, the statement simplifies the complexity of forms of expression.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 195, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"All who have died are equal.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"All who have died are equal\" can be interpreted in different ways. If we consider it in the sense that death is a common fate shared by all living beings, regardless of their status, wealth, or power during life, then it suggests a kind of equality in mortality. In this context, it implies that death is a great equalizer that removes distinctions among individuals. However, if we consider the statement in terms of how individuals are remembered, honored, or treated after death, there can be significant differences based on cultural, historical, or personal factors. Some individuals may be celebrated and remembered for centuries, while others may be forgotten. This indicates that there is inequality in how the deceased are regarded and commemorated.\n\nIn conclusion, while death itself is a universal and equalizing phenomenon, the way individuals are remembered or honored after death can vary greatly. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 196, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"Allowing eligible voters to vote online allows more voters to participate in elections and strengthens democracy.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that online voting could increase voter participation by making it more convenient and accessible for eligible voters to cast their ballots. This could be particularly beneficial for those who face barriers to voting in person, such as those with disabilities, illness, or conflicting work schedules. Increased participation in elections could lead to a more representative and responsive government, which is a cornerstone of a strong democracy. However, considerations related to the security and integrity of online voting systems are essential to ensure that the process is reliable and trustworthy. Nevertheless, the potential to expand voter access and participation aligns with democratic principles. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 197, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"Allowing family visits to care homes during pandemic will enhance the quality of life and mental health of residents and their families.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that allowing family visits to care homes during a pandemic can improve the quality of life and mental health of residents and their families. Family visits can provide emotional support, reduce feelings of isolation, and maintain strong bonds, which are crucial for mental well-being. Additionally, seeing loved ones can uplift the spirits of residents, providing comfort and a sense of normalcy during uncertain times. However, there is also a risk of increased exposure to the virus for both residents and their families. Balancing safety protocols with the benefits of family interaction is key. Given the positive impact on mental health and quality of life when managed safely, it is reasonable to consider the statement as common sense. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 198, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"Allowing guns is not about good guys with guns deterring violent crime because a study of 33 states indicates that permitting guns have increased violent crime from 13 to 15.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that permitting guns has led to an increase in violent crime, based on a study of 33 states. To evaluate the common sense nature of this statement, we should consider the reliability of the study mentioned and the broader context of gun control policies and their effects on crime rates. If the study is robust and well-conducted, and if the findings align with other research indicating similar trends, the statement could be considered as reflecting common sense. However, without additional information about the study's methodology, the specific contexts of the states involved, and other factors influencing crime rates, it's difficult to definitively say that the statement is common sense. Thus, a cautious approach would be appropriate.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 199, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"Allowing people to have their own religious belief without disruption is kind.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "Allowing people to have their own religious beliefs without disruption is a demonstration of respect and tolerance for individual freedoms and diversity. In many societies, it is a fundamental right to have freedom of religion, and protecting this right contributes to a peaceful and inclusive community. Disrupting or interfering with someone's religious beliefs can lead to conflict and societal unrest. Therefore, promoting kindness through respecting others' beliefs is not only considerate but also essential for maintaining harmony. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 200, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"Although a large and famous country britian is an island.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"Although a large and famous country, Britain is an island\" is common sense to those with a basic understanding of geography. Britain, referring to the island that comprises England, Scotland, and Wales, is indeed an island and is recognized globally for its historical and cultural significance. The statement highlights the contrast between Britain's size and influence in the world and its geographical status as an island. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 201, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"Although some people who smoke live a very long life the more a person smokes the greater the risk to their health.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement in question aligns with widely accepted scientific findings that smoking is harmful to health. Numerous studies have shown that smoking increases the risk of various diseases, including cancer, heart disease, and respiratory illnesses. While it is true that some individuals who smoke may live long lives, this does not negate the overall increased health risks associated with smoking. The statement reflects the general understanding that smoking poses a greater risk to health the more one engages in the habit. Therefore, the statement can be considered common sense as it is consistent with established medical knowledge. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 202, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"Although the world is not perfect it is yet the best that is possible.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"Although the world is not perfect it is yet the best that is possible\" suggests that while there are flaws and imperfections in the world, it is the best possible version that could exist given the circumstances. This idea can be interpreted as a form of philosophical optimism, which posits that the world is the best of all possible worlds that could have been created. \n\nHowever, whether or not this statement is considered common sense depends on one's perspective and philosophical outlook. For some, it might provide comfort and a sense of acceptance of the world's imperfections. For others, it could be seen as a passive acceptance and may undermine efforts towards improvement and progress.\n\nIn terms of common sense, which generally involves practical and sound judgment, the statement might not align completely. Common sense would likely encourage continuous evaluation and efforts to improve the world, rather than settling for the notion that it is already the best possible version.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 203, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"Although we can see others' reactions to their inner experience we cannot actually perceive or experience their actual inner experience their qualia.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement addresses the concept of qualia, which refers to individual subjective experiences that are unique to each person. It suggests that while we can observe external reactions and expressions of others, we cannot directly access or experience their internal subjective experiences. This aligns with the idea that each person's consciousness and perceptions are private and inaccessible to others. Given that this perspective emphasizes the limits of human empathy and understanding in fully grasping another person's internal experiences, it is a concept that is generally acknowledged in discussions of consciousness and philosophy of mind. Therefore, the statement aligns with a commonly understood aspect of human experience.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 204, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"Altruism is commonsense for people.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "Altruism, defined as selfless concern for the well-being of others, is often considered a desirable trait because it can lead to cooperative and harmonious social interactions. From an evolutionary perspective, altruistic behavior can increase the survival and reproductive success of groups, which could explain why it might be seen as commonsense for people to engage in altruistic acts. Additionally, many cultures and moral systems promote altruism as a virtue, which can further reinforce the idea that altruism is commonsense behavior. However, whether or not altruism is truly commonsense can vary depending on individual beliefs, values, and experiences. Some may prioritize self-interest or have different interpretations of what constitutes sensible behavior.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 205, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"Altruism is the foundation of peaceful society.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "Altruism, or selfless concern for the well-being of others, can promote cooperation and social cohesion, which are essential for a peaceful society. By prioritizing the needs and welfare of others, individuals can help reduce conflict and foster mutual understanding and respect. When people act altruistically, they contribute to a collective sense of trust and security that can discourage violence and aggression. Moreover, altruism can encourage empathy and compassion, which are key components in resolving disputes and promoting harmony within a community. Therefore, it can be argued that altruism is indeed a fundamental component of maintaining a peaceful society.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 206, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"Always and never are two words you should always remember never to use.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"Always and never are two words you should always remember never to use\" is a reminder to avoid speaking in absolutes. Using the words \"always\" and \"never\" can be limiting and may not accurately reflect the complexity and variability of life situations. It encourages more thoughtful and nuanced communication. The irony in the statement, using the words it advises against, emphasizes the point through contradiction. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 207, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"Always feel free to give a support.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"Always feel free to give support\" can be seen as common sense because helping others and providing support is generally encouraged and valued in society.

Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"Always remember your focus determines your reality\" suggests that the direction of one's attention and thoughts can shape their perception and experiences in life. This idea aligns with psychological principles such as the self-fulfilling prophecy and cognitive-behavioral theories, which emphasize the impact of mindset and focus on personal outcomes. The notion that focusing on positive or negative aspects can influence one's reality is also supported by research in positive psychology. Therefore, the statement carries a level of intuitive understanding about the power of mindset in shaping one's experiences. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 209, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"Always triple check that your parts are compatible before buying computer parts.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"Always triple check that your parts are compatible before buying computer parts\" is a reminder to ensure that the components of a computer will work together effectively. Compatibility is crucial in computer hardware, as using incompatible parts can lead to system failures, poor performance, or even damage to the components.

{"id": 210, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"Always trust in god.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"Always trust in god\" is subjective and based on individual beliefs and personal faith. It is not necessarily common sense, as common sense generally refers to practical and sound judgment that is widely agreed upon by a majority. Belief in and trust in god varies greatly among different cultures, religions, and individuals. Therefore, the statement may resonate as truth for some, but not for others, based on their personal faith and experiences.\n\nSo the answer is no."}

Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"Ambition is not a vice of little people\" implies that ambition is not solely a characteristic of those who are considered insignificant or unimportant. It suggests that ambition is a trait that can be found in individuals of all statures and backgrounds, regardless of their perceived importance in society. Ambition is a universal human quality that drives people to strive for success and achievement, regardless of their starting point or social standing.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 212, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"America did the right thing when it broke away from britain in 1776.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement that \"America did the right thing when it broke away from Britain in 1776\" is often considered common sense from an American perspective because it led to the establishment of an independent nation free from British rule. The colonists were experiencing taxation without representation and other forms of perceived oppression, and the desire for self-governance and freedom were strong motivating factors. The successful breakaway allowed for the creation of the United States Constitution and the development of a democratic government that aligns with the values of liberty and individual rights. From this viewpoint, the decision to seek independence is seen as a positive and necessary step toward the creation of a new nation that better reflected the ideals of its inhabitants. So the answer is yes."}

Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"America is a place where courage and conviction can make a difference\" reflects a belief in the power of individual action and determination. Historically, many social and political changes in America have been driven by individuals and groups who possessed courage and strong convictions. Examples include the civil rights movement, women's suffrage, and various labor rights movements. These movements demonstrate that individuals with courage and conviction have been able to challenge the status quo and bring about significant changes in American society. Therefore, the statement aligns with historical evidence showing that individual actions can indeed make a difference in America.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 214, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"America should strive to uphold democracy and human rights across the world.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"America should strive to uphold democracy and human rights across the world\" reflects a belief in the promotion of democratic values and human rights as a fundamental aspect of foreign policy. Advocates argue that supporting democracy and human rights internationally can lead to a more stable and peaceful global environment, reduce conflicts, and improve diplomatic relations. Additionally, promoting these values aligns with the principles upon which America was founded and can enhance the country's moral standing in the world.\n\nHowever, critics may argue that prioritizing the promotion of democracy and human rights internationally can lead to unintended consequences, such as interference in the internal affairs of other nations, which might be perceived as neocolonialism or imperialism. Furthermore, the practical implementation of this goal can be complex and context-dependent, as different countries have unique historical, cultural, and political backgrounds.\n\nDespite these challenges, the idea of promoting democracy and human rights globally is grounded in the belief in the universality of these values and their importance in ensuring human dignity and freedom. So the answer is yes."}

In a society that values equality and justice, it makes sense to support and protect all individuals, regardless of their background. By fostering an inclusive environment and safeguarding the rights of diverse groups, we can promote social harmony and equal opportunities for all. Ensuring legal protections against discrimination and exploitation is crucial for maintaining the integrity and fairness of society. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 216, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"American's need to enact pollicies that made american great again.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"Americans need to enact policies that made America great again\" carries an assumption that there was a specific point in time when America was \"great\" and that the policies from that time should be reinstated. However, the idea of what makes a country \"great\" is subjective and can vary greatly depending on individual perspectives and values. Additionally, the context in which previous policies were effective may have changed, making them less applicable or effective in the present day. Therefore, it is not necessarily common sense to assume that reinstating old policies would automatically lead to a better future. So the answer is no."}

Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"Americans are greedy as a society\" is a generalization and may not accurately reflect the values and behaviors of all individuals within the society. While there may be instances or examples of greed within American society, it is important to consider the diversity of values and motivations among the population. Additionally, labeling an entire society as greedy may overlook the philanthropic and charitable efforts that also exist within the culture. Therefore, it is not necessarily common sense to make such a blanket statement without considering the complexities and variations within the society.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 219, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"Americans are hard working and have optimism.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"Americans are hard working and have optimism\" is a generalization and may not apply to every individual. However, it is a common stereotype or perception that has been perpetuated in media and cultural narratives, which depicts Americans as industrious and hopeful about the future.

Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"Americans know what is right and wrong\" assumes that there is a universal understanding of morality among all Americans, which may not be accurate. Different individuals and cultures within America may have different beliefs and values, leading to varying perceptions of right and wrong. Additionally, moral judgments can be influenced by various factors such as upbringing, education, and personal experiences. Therefore, it is not necessarily common sense to assume that all Americans share the same moral compass.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 222, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"Americans want progressive values.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"Americans want progressive values\" is a generalization and does not necessarily reflect the views of all Americans. The United States is a diverse country with a wide range of political beliefs, and opinions on values can vary significantly among individuals and regions. While some Americans may prioritize progressive values, others may prioritize conservative or other values. Therefore, it is not accurate to say that all Americans want progressive values.

Apples are a good source of fiber, vitamins, and antioxidants, which can benefit various aspects of health such as digestion, heart health, and immune function. However, while apples can be a healthy part of one's diet, relying solely on eating an apple a day without considering other health factors such as a balanced diet, exercise, and regular medical check-ups is overly simplistic. The statement is not to be taken literally but rather serves as a reminder of the importance of a healthy diet. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 227, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"An education isn`t how much you have committed to memory or even how much you know it`s being able to differentiate between what you know and what you don`t.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that education is not solely about memorizing facts or accumulating knowledge, but rather the ability to discern what one knows from what one does not know.

This perspective encourages a more thoughtful and adaptive approach to learning, which is indeed a sensible and valuable aspect of education. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 228, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"An eminent reputation is as dangerous as a bad one.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that having a highly esteemed reputation can be just as risky as having a poor one. This could be because high expectations and visibility may make a person or entity more susceptible to scrutiny and criticism, and any mistake could be amplified and lead to a greater fall from grace. Additionally, an eminent reputation may invite jealousy or competition, potentially leading to sabotage or efforts to tarnish one's image. However, a bad reputation can lead to distrust, lost opportunities, and difficulty in building relationships or achieving goals. Both scenarios have their challenges, but they are not necessarily equally dangerous as they present different risks and consequences.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 229, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"An ideal wife is one who remains faithful to you but tries to be just as charming as if she weren`t.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that an ideal wife should be loyal while also maintaining an appealing demeanor as if she were still trying to win her partner's affection. This perspective may be seen as traditional and could imply that a wife's primary roles are to be faithful and charming. However, modern views on relationships emphasize mutual respect, trust, communication, and partnership beyond just charm and fidelity.\n\nDifferent individuals and cultures may have varying expectations and definitions of what qualities are ideal in a spouse.

Therefore, the statement appears to be based on common sense as it reflects observable trends and medical knowledge. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 231, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"An intelligent hell would be better than a stupid paradise.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"An intelligent hell would be better than a stupid paradise\" suggests that an environment where one can engage intellectually, even if it is difficult or unpleasant, is preferable to a blissful environment devoid of intellectual stimulation. The reasoning behind this statement could be that intellectual engagement and growth are seen as inherently valuable, and contribute to a more meaningful and fulfilling existence, even in adverse conditions. Conversely, a lack of intellectual stimulation, even in an ostensibly perfect or blissful setting, could lead to stagnation and a lack of personal growth. Thus, the value placed on intellectual fulfillment over simple contentment or pleasure determines one's agreement with the statement.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 232, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"An invitation would make you want to go to a party.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"An invitation would make you want to go to a party\" is based on the idea that receiving an invitation can create a sense of inclusion and anticipation, which may increase one's interest in attending the event. An invitation can make someone feel valued and considered, which can be appealing. However, the desire to attend a party can also depend on other factors such as the nature of the party, the attendees, personal preferences, and prior commitments. Therefore, while an invitation might contribute to the interest in attending a party, it doesn't necessarily determine it. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 233, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"An open border leaves citizens unprotected and presents a conflict between the governed and the government.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement that an open border leaves citizens unprotected and presents a conflict between the governed and the government can be seen as common sense to some because it suggests that without proper border controls, a country may be vulnerable to various security risks, such as unauthorized entry, illegal activities, and potential threats to public safety. Additionally, if citizens feel that their safety is compromised, it could lead to a lack of trust and conflict between the public and the government, as the government is generally expected to ensure the security and well-being of its citizens.\n\nHowever, the interpretation of this statement can vary depending on one's perspective on immigration, national security, and the role of government in managing borders. Some may argue that open borders can foster positive outcomes such as increased cultural exchange, economic growth, and humanitarian benefits.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 234, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"An ounce of performance is worth pounds of promises.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"An ounce of performance is worth pounds of promises\" emphasizes the value of action over mere words. It suggests that delivering tangible results, even in small amounts, is more meaningful and impactful than making grand promises without follow-through. This idea aligns with the common sense notion that actions speak louder than words, and that real-world outcomes are more reliable indicators of capability and intention than verbal commitments alone. \n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 235, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"Anchors should not ask loaded questions to their interviewees.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "Loaded questions are those that contain an assumption or are framed in such a way that they pressure the interviewee to respond in a particular manner. This can lead to biased or manipulated responses, which undermines the integrity of the interview and the credibility of the anchor. Journalism should aim to be fair and impartial, allowing interviewees to freely express their views without being influenced by the phrasing of the questions. Using loaded questions can also damage the trust between the interviewer and the audience, as it may appear that the interviewer is pushing a specific agenda. Therefore, anchors should avoid asking loaded questions to maintain the quality and impartiality of the interview.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 236, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"Animal agriculture is responsible for many greenhouse gases therefore raising cattle causes global warming.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement links animal agriculture, specifically raising cattle, to global warming through the production of greenhouse gases. It is well-documented that animal agriculture, including cattle farming, produces significant amounts of methane, a potent greenhouse gas. Methane has a much higher warming potential than carbon dioxide, and it is released during the digestive process of cattle and other ruminant animals. Additionally, cattle farming requires large amounts of land, often leading to deforestation, which further contributes to global warming by reducing the number of trees that can absorb carbon dioxide. Given the scientific evidence supporting the role of methane from cattle in global warming, the statement aligns with factual data.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}

Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"Animals are instinctively afraid of the sight or even the track of man\" may not necessarily be common sense for a few reasons. Firstly, not all animals exhibit the same behavior when encountering humans. Some animals, such as those habituated to human presence in urban environments or certain domesticated animals, may not exhibit fear. Additionally, the level of fear can vary depending on the animal's past experiences with humans, which can shape their perception and reaction. It is also important to consider that some animals may exhibit curiosity rather than fear. Therefore, the statement is an overgeneralization and does not account for the diversity in animal behavior.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 238, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"Ann will help people who are in trouble.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"Ann will help people who are in trouble\" suggests that Ann is a caring and helpful individual who is willing to assist those in need. This kind of behavior is generally considered virtuous and commendable in society. However, without knowing more about Ann's specific personality traits, circumstances, and willingness to help, it's difficult to definitively say whether this statement reflects common sense. Common sense would typically dictate that not all individuals may act in the same way in similar situations, and one's behavior can depend on various factors. Thus, assuming that Ann will always help without more context might not align with common sense, which takes into account variability in human behavior.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 239, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"Another democratic vote can help secure what's good for our future.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"Another democratic vote can help secure what's good for our future\" suggests that voting in a democratic process can influence positive outcomes for the future. This is based on the idea that democratic voting enables citizens to express their preferences and choose leaders or policies that align with their interests and values. If the majority of the population votes in favor of beneficial policies or competent leaders, it can potentially lead to better governance and positive changes, which can be good for the future.\n\nHowever, the effectiveness of a democratic vote in securing a positive future also depends on factors such as the integrity of the electoral process, the availability of accurate information, and the engagement and education of the electorate. Without these factors, the results of a democratic vote might not necessarily lead to the best outcomes.\n\nDespite these considerations, the principle that democratic voting can be a mechanism to influence and shape the future in a positive way is generally aligned with democratic ideals. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 240, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"Another victory like that one and we are lost.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement, \"Another victory like that one and we are lost,\" implies that the victory in question came at a great cost or had significant negative consequences. It suggests that if similar victories were to occur, the cumulative negative impact would outweigh the benefits and ultimately lead to defeat or ruin. This type of statement is often used to emphasize the importance of evaluating the true cost of a victory beyond just the immediate success. It is a reminder to consider the long-term effects and sustainability of one's actions. Therefore, the statement can be seen as common sense because it encourages a more holistic evaluation of success and its implications.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}

Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that anxiety in children primarily stems from the fear of losing a loved one. While it is true that separation anxiety is a common and normal part of childhood development and can manifest as anxiety when a child is separated from their caregivers, it's important to recognize that anxiety in children can have multiple sources beyond just the fear of losing a loved one. These can include biological factors, environmental influences, learned behaviors, and other psychological stressors. Therefore, the statement is an oversimplification of the complex nature of anxiety in children. So the answer is no."}

Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"Anyone can talk to god but god only talks back to crazy people\" is a subjective and potentially controversial claim that relates to personal beliefs about spirituality and mental health. It implies that communication with a deity is unidirectional for most people, but those who claim to hear responses are mentally ill. This is a broad generalization and may not align with the diverse beliefs and experiences of individuals regarding spirituality and mental health. It also carries a stigma about mental health by equating experiences of hearing voices or having certain spiritual experiences with being \"crazy.\" \n\nAs such, the statement does not reflect a universal truth or common sense, as it oversimplifies complex issues and varies greatly depending on personal, cultural, and religious perspectives. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 246, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"Anything that is too stupid to be spoken is sung.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement, \"Anything that is too stupid to be spoken is sung,\" is an exaggeration and should not be taken literally. Singing, like speaking, is a form of expression and can convey a wide range of ideas and emotions, including profound and intelligent ones. The assertion that only \"stupid\" things are sung undermines the value and significance of music and lyrics in culture and art. Many songs contain meaningful messages, tell stories, or express complex emotions that are not \"stupid.\" Therefore, the statement is not reflective of common sense. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 247, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"Apparently men can be cured of drugs drink gambling biting his nails and picking his nose but not of marrying.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement seems to express a humorous or sarcastic perspective on the perceived difficulty of changing certain habits or behaviors, including marriage. It suggests that while some habits like drug use, excessive drinking, and minor nervous habits such as nail-biting and nose-picking can be addressed or treated, the decision to marry is seen as something unchangeable or irreversible. This is likely an exaggeration, as marriage, like any other personal decision, can be reconsidered or ended through divorce if necessary. The statement plays on the idea that marriage is a lifelong commitment that one cannot easily \"cure\" oneself of, highlighting the cultural importance placed on the institution of marriage.\n\nHowever, in terms of common sense, the statement is overly simplistic and doesn't account for the complexities of personal choice and the ability to change one's life circumstances, including marital status. It also improperly compares serious issues like drug addiction to everyday habits and a significant life choice like marriage. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 248, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"Apple can be red.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"Apple can be red\" is common sense because it is a widely known fact that apples come in various colors, including red.

Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"Arizonans have solid conservative values\" is a generalization and may not accurately reflect the views of all individuals in the state. Arizona is a diverse state with a mix of political beliefs, and while it has historically leaned conservative, there has been a shift towards more moderate and liberal views in recent years. Additionally, the definition of \"conservative values\" can vary widely among individuals. Therefore, it is not necessarily common sense to assume that all Arizonans have solid conservative values. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 252, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"Arresting criminals is for cops and courts not politicians.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"Arresting criminals is for cops and courts not politicians\" is based on the separation of powers and the roles of different branches of government. Law enforcement and the judiciary are responsible for arresting, prosecuting, and adjudicating crimes, while politicians, as part of the legislative or executive branches, are meant to create and enact laws or policies. Politicians do not have the training or authority to directly engage in law enforcement activities, which are carried out by designated agencies and professionals. It is essential for maintaining the rule of law and preventing abuses of power to keep these roles distinct. So the answer is yes."}

This idea aligns with the common understanding that mastery in any field, including art, often involves perseverance, dedication, and hard work. Many famous masterpieces, whether in visual arts, literature, or music, have been created after long periods of experimentation, practice, and refinement. This process usually involves facing and overcoming various obstacles, which is an essential part of the creative journey. Therefore, the statement resonates with the general belief that exceptional achievements are not accomplished easily or without struggle.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}

Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "Many people find inspiration in art, as it often evokes emotions, ideas, and personal connections. Museums, being repositories of diverse and significant works of art, provide an ideal environment for individuals to engage with art deeply. The visual elements, themes, and historical contexts of artworks can serve as rich sources of inspiration for storytelling.

Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that as people age, their various passions and ambitions ultimately boil down to a desire for money. This perspective might be seen as cynical, as it reduces the complexity of human motivation to a single factor. People have various reasons for their actions and pursuits, which can include love, self-fulfillment, altruism, and other intrinsic values that are not necessarily tied to financial gain. While it is true that financial stability is a common and practical concern, it is an oversimplification to say that all passions ultimately become a pursuit of money. Each individual's experiences and values shape their motivations differently.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 257, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"As people go their own way destiny goes with them.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"As people go their own way destiny goes with them\" suggests that an individual's choices and actions determine their fate or destiny. This aligns with the idea that we have control over our own lives and that our decisions shape our future.

As societies advance economically and technologically, the minimum requirements to participate fully in society increase, raising the standards of what is considered poverty. This implies that the relative measure of poverty evolves with societal progress. So the answer is yes."}

Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement draws a humorous analogy between a writer's relationship with criticism and a lamppost's relationship with dogs. It suggests that criticism is as unavoidable and perhaps as unpleasant for a writer as a dog using a lamppost is for the lamppost. The analogy underscores the idea that criticism is a natural part of a writer's life, much like dogs are naturally drawn to lampposts. It also implies that criticism, like the dog's actions, is something that happens to writers, whether they like it or not.\n\nGiven this interpretation, the statement can be seen as emphasizing the inevitability and frequent unpleasantness of criticism in a writer's career, which could be considered a common-sense observation about the nature of creative work and public scrutiny. \n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 261, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"Assassination is the extreme form of censorship.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"Assassination is the extreme form of censorship\" implies that assassination is a means of silencing someone, thereby suppressing their ability to communicate or express ideas. Censorship typically involves the suppression or prohibition of speech, public communication, or other information, which may be considered harmful, sensitive, or inconvenient by authorities. Assassination, being the act of deliberately killing someone, can be viewed as an ultimate way to prevent an individual from expressing or sharing their thoughts and ideas, thus permanently censoring them.\n\nWhile censorship usually refers to the suppression of words, images, or ideas, assassination physically removes the individual, ensuring they can no longer contribute to discourse. Hence, in a metaphorical sense, assassination could be seen as an extreme form of censorship since it achieves the ultimate suppression of a voice or influence.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 262, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"Assist them in an invention help them scratch.\" Do you think this statement is common sense?

While the phrasing might not be immediately clear, the underlying idea of providing help that directly addresses a need is reasonable. However, the statement itself is not a common expression or a widely recognized piece of common sense advice due to its ambiguity and lack of clarity. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 263, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"At twenty everyone is republican.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"At twenty everyone is republican\" is not necessarily common sense. Political affiliations and beliefs are influenced by a variety of factors including upbringing, education, social environment, and personal experiences. Additionally, political beliefs can vary greatly from person to person and can change over time.

Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that authority is dependent on prestige, and prestige requires a certain level of distance or separation from others to be maintained. Authority often comes with a level of respect or admiration, which can be considered as prestige. If an authoritative figure lacks prestige, their influence or commands may not be taken as seriously. Similarly, prestige often requires a certain level of distance or exclusivity, as being too accessible or familiar can diminish the perception of superiority or special status. Therefore, the statement implies a symbiotic relationship between authority and prestige, supported by distance. This reasoning aligns with common observations about social dynamics and hierarchy.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 267, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"Avoid close contact with people who are ill.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"Avoid close contact with people who are ill\" is generally considered common sense because it helps prevent the spread of infectious diseases.

Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that while poor management can undermine effective policies, skilled administration cannot salvage flawed policies. This implies that the quality of the policy itself is a fundamental determinant of its success, regardless of how well it is implemented. Considering that effective policies are typically well-reasoned and aligned with goals, while flawed policies may have inherent issues that cannot be rectified by execution alone, this statement seems logical. Thus, the quality of the policy is paramount, and good administration, while beneficial, cannot compensate for inherent policy weaknesses. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 269, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"Balls are round.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"Balls are round\" is generally considered common sense because the most typical and widely recognized shape for an object referred to as a \"ball\" is a sphere, which is round. This understanding is based on common experiences and the standard definition of balls used in various sports and activities, such as soccer, basketball, and tennis, all of which involve spherical objects. Therefore, the notion that balls are round aligns with everyday observations and the conventional usage of the term. So the answer is yes."}

{"id": 272, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"Bats are the only flying mammal.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"Bats are the only flying mammal\" refers to the capability of sustained flight, meaning the ability to generate lift and fly through the air for a substantial duration. Bats belong to the order Chiroptera and are indeed the only mammals that have evolved to fly in this manner. Other mammals like flying squirrels, sugar gliders, and colugos can glide for limited distances but do not exhibit true powered flight like bats. These gliding mammals possess adaptations such as skin membranes that allow them to glide from one point to another but they cannot gain altitude or engage in the flapping flight that bats can. Therefore, when considering the definition of 'flying' as powered, sustained flight, bats meet this criterion exclusively among mammals. So the answer is yes."}

This idea aligns with the concept of making decisions based on the best available information, even if it's not perfect, rather than striving for precision that could lead to greater errors. In many real-world scenarios, such as forecasting or decision-making under uncertainty, being approximately right can be more beneficial and practical than being exactly wrong. This approach allows for flexibility and adaptability, which are crucial in dynamic environments.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}

Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"Be gentle to your enemy same as to an old oven\" is a metaphorical expression suggesting that one should treat their enemy with caution and care, similar to how one would handle an old oven that may be fragile and requires gentle handling to avoid damage or breakage. This idea may not be common sense to everyone, as the natural instinct might be to act defensively or aggressively towards an enemy rather than with gentleness. The comparison to an old oven is also not a typical or intuitive analogy for most people. Therefore, understanding and applying this statement may not be straightforward or universally accepted as common sense.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 276, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"Be too busy to have time for regrets.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"Be too busy to have time for regrets\" suggests that by keeping oneself occupied with meaningful activities, one may not dwell on past mistakes or missed opportunities. The logic behind this is that focusing on the present and future endeavors can divert attention away from regretful thinking, promoting a more forward-looking and productive mindset. Regret can often be paralyzing and unproductive, so staying busy with constructive tasks could potentially minimize its impact on one's emotional well-being and overall productivity. Therefore, the statement advocates for a proactive approach to life, which can be seen as sensible to some extent. However, it is also important to acknowledge and reflect on past experiences, as they can provide valuable lessons for personal growth. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 277, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"Be who you are and say what you feel because those who mind don't matter and those who matter don't mind.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement encourages authenticity and honesty in expressing oneself, suggesting that the opinions of others should not deter someone from being true to themselves. It implies that the people who truly care about and value an individual will accept them for who they are, regardless of differing opinions or feelings. This perspective can help individuals prioritize their own well-being and maintain genuine relationships. However, it's important to consider that this advice may not always be practical in every situation, as context and the potential impact of one's words on others should also be taken into account. Despite that, the essence of the message promotes self-confidence and emotional freedom, which can be seen as fundamentally sensible. So the answer is yes."}

It also encourages a more harmonious relationship with others as it promotes respect and equality. This approach can contribute to better communication and understanding among individuals.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}

Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement plays on stereotypes about romantic relationships and marriage, suggesting that before marriage, a man is more attentive and invested in conversations, whereas after marriage, he becomes less engaged. It relies on a generalization that may not be true for all relationships, as each relationship is unique and individual couples may have different dynamics. Furthermore, it promotes a somewhat negative view of marriage, implying a decline in attentiveness and interest over time. \n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 280, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"Before receiving unemployment compensation a peron must show the proof of identity.\" Do you think this statement is common sense?

Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"Cancel culture should not be tolerated in a developed society\" addresses the idea of holding individuals or organizations accountable for their actions, often by ostracizing them from social or professional circles. While some view cancel culture as a necessary tool for social justice, others argue that it can lead to a lack of due process, suppression of free speech, and a toxic environment where people are afraid to express their opinions.\n\nIn a developed society, where values such as free speech, due process, and open dialogue are upheld, cancel culture can be seen as contrary to these principles. It often involves punitive actions without a fair investigation or opportunity for the accused to respond. This can result in harm to individuals' reputations and careers based on potentially unfounded accusations.\n\nMoreover, cancel culture can stifle the exchange of ideas and inhibit societal progress.

Common sense generally refers to sound practical judgment that is not based on specialized knowledge. The characterization of an entire political party as one of doom would depend on individual perspectives, specific contexts, and interpretations of the party's actions and policies.

Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement implies that an individual's creative output is a reflection of their own identity, experiences, and perspective. This makes sense because creators often draw upon their personal thoughts, emotions, and experiences when producing their work, consciously or unconsciously incorporating elements of themselves into their creations. Additionally, the choices they make in terms of style, subject matter, and technique can reveal aspects of their personality and worldview. Therefore, it can be argued that every work of art or creative endeavor is, in some way, a self-portrait of its creator.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}

Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that everyone holds a belief in a higher power or deity, whether it is a god or a force that controls their life. However, this assumption discounts the diversity of beliefs and non-beliefs among individuals, including atheism and agnosticism, where people do not necessarily subscribe to the idea of a superior being or any divine entity. Therefore, it is not accurate to say that \"everybody\" shares this belief, as personal convictions vary greatly across different cultures and individuals. So the answer is no."}

This idea aligns with psychological concepts such as egocentrism, where people naturally consider their own experiences and viewpoints first. Additionally, self-narrative and identity construction are fundamental aspects of human cognition and social behavior, supporting the idea that everyone perceives themselves as the main character in their life story. Therefore, the statement reflects a common understanding of individual perspective and self-centered cognition.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}

This often leads to individuals being promoted until they reach a position in which they are no longer competent. \n\nThis concept highlights a common flaw in organizational management where promotions are based on current job performance rather than on abilities relevant to the new role. As such, it can be considered common sense because it reflects a widely observed phenomenon in the workplace where employees may end up in positions where they cannot perform effectively.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 512, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"Everyone's view of the divine is different as everyone has a different personality.\" Do you think this statement is common sense?

This idea aligns with the understanding that personal experiences, upbringing, culture, and inherent personality can shape one's beliefs and perceptions. Since no two individuals have the exact same combination of these factors, it logically follows that their views on such a complex and subjective topic as the divine would differ. Therefore, the statement can be seen as common sense, as it acknowledges the natural diversity in human thought and experience. So the answer is yes."}

This idea aligns with the philosophical concept that beauty is in the eye of the beholder, meaning that what one person finds beautiful, another may not. The statement also implies that recognizing beauty requires a certain level of awareness or openness, which not everyone may possess.\n\nGiven that the perception of beauty is subjective and can be influenced by personal experiences, cultural backgrounds, and individual tastes, it is reasonable to say that not everyone will see beauty in the same things. Therefore, the statement encourages a broader perspective and appreciation for diversity in opinions about beauty.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}

{"id": 543, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"Fear and hope are the parents of god.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"Fear and hope are the parents of god\" suggests that the concept of god is born out of human emotions, specifically fear and hope. Fear might lead people to seek protection and comfort, while hope might inspire people to believe in a higher power or divine intervention. This interpretation relies on a psychological perspective on the origins of religious beliefs.\n\nHowever, whether this statement is considered common sense largely depends on individual belief systems and cultural backgrounds. For some, the idea that emotions shape religious beliefs might resonate and seem intuitive. For others, who might believe in the divine origin of god independent of human emotions, this statement might not align with their views.\n\nSo the answer is no."}

Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"Fear has no brains, it is an idiot\" suggests that fear is not rational or logical, but rather a primal and instinctual response. Fear can often cause individuals to react without thinking clearly, driven by the survival-oriented fight or flight response. This can lead to irrational decisions or actions that may not make sense when analyzed calmly and logically. Therefore, the statement implies that fear does not involve thoughtful reasoning or intelligence.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 545, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"Federal aid should be given to business who need to recover from economic turmoil.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"Federal aid should be given to businesses who need to recover from economic turmoil\" suggests that government support is necessary for businesses facing financial difficulties due to external economic factors. Providing aid can help stabilize the economy, preserve jobs, and maintain essential services that businesses provide. Additionally, supporting businesses during economic downturns can prevent further economic decline and promote a quicker recovery. However, considerations such as the allocation of resources, potential dependency on government aid, and fairness need to be taken into account. Despite these concerns, the overall goal of stabilizing the economy and preserving employment may justify federal aid to businesses in distress. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 546, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"Feigned indifference doesn't get you what you want try being earnest.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"Feigned indifference doesn't get you what you want try being earnest\" suggests that pretending not to care about something may not yield the desired results, and that being sincere and genuine might be more effective.

People are generally more responsive and willing to help or cooperate when they feel they are dealing with someone who is earnest and truthful. Additionally, feigning indifference might lead to misunderstandings or missed opportunities, as others may not recognize your true intentions or interests. Therefore, being earnest can be seen as a more straightforward and reliable approach to achieving one's goals. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 547, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"Few persons enjoy real liberty we are all slaves to ideas or habits.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"Few persons enjoy real liberty; we are all slaves to ideas or habits\" suggests that true freedom is rare because people are often constrained by their own thoughts and behaviors. This idea has some merit, as individuals can be influenced by societal norms, personal beliefs, and ingrained routines that may limit their ability to make independent choices. On the other hand, one could argue that having ideas and habits does not necessarily equate to a lack of freedom, as people can choose to change their perspectives and behaviors. However, the statement highlights an important aspect of human psychology, where mental and habitual patterns can significantly impact one's sense of autonomy and liberty. So the answer is yes."}

This perspective emphasizes the importance of personal alignment and comfort with the teachings and principles of a religion. It supports the idea that religion should be a source of guidance, solace, and inspiration in a way that matches one's own understanding and lifestyle.\n\nHowever, religion can also be seen as a profound commitment that might challenge personal preferences to foster growth, community, and deeper understanding. Thus, choosing a religion solely based on personal preferences might overlook the transformative and communal aspects that many religions offer.\n\nFrom this perspective, the statement could be seen as somewhat reductive by not accounting for the broader implications and responsibilities that come with religious adherence. Therefore, whether this statement is common sense depends on one's view of what religion should primarily provide to an individual.\n\nSo the answer is no."}

This emphasizes the subjective nature of perspective and how it can shape one's experience and attitude towards life. Since the statement illustrates a fundamental aspect of human psychology regarding optimism and pessimism, it can be considered common sense as it resonates with general understanding of these outlooks.

{"id": 559, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"For thousands of years human physical attraction was between a man and a woman it was a given sans the greek's and other pagan religions now we are expected not only to accept the anomaly but to exalt their deviance.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement presented reflects a subjective and historically inaccurate view of human relationships and attraction.

Many other societies, including certain Native American tribes and some Asian cultures, have acknowledged and respected non-heterosexual relationships.\n\nThe use of terms like \"anomaly\" and \"deviance\" in the statement also suggests a biased and judgmental perspective that does not align with contemporary understandings of human sexuality and gender, which recognize that sexual orientation and gender identity exist on a spectrum.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 560, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"For what you see and hear depends a good deal on where you are standing it also depends on what sort of person you are.\" Do you think this statement is common sense?

Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "Compensating freed prisoners for unlawful detention can be seen as a matter of justice and fairness. Being detained unlawfully means that an individual has had their rights violated and has potentially suffered both emotionally and financially as a result. Compensation could help address the harm caused by the wrongful detention and support the individual's reintegration into society. It can also act as a deterrent against future errors or misconduct within the justice system.\n\nHowever, the idea of compensation also raises questions about the criteria for determining eligibility, the source of funding for such compensation, and the potential for abuse or false claims. Each of these factors would need to be carefully considered and addressed in implementing a compensation policy.\n\nGiven the importance of upholding justice and acknowledging the harm caused by wrongful detention, it seems reasonable that freed prisoners should receive some form of redress. So the answer is yes."}

Children are known for their innocence and straightforwardness, often saying things as they see them without filtering their thoughts. Similarly, individuals with certain mental conditions may have altered perceptions or less concern for social conventions, leading them to express themselves in a more unfiltered manner.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that the statement might oversimplify the complexities of truth-telling and the diverse experiences of individuals with mental health conditions. While children and some individuals with mental health conditions might indeed express their thoughts more openly, their interpretations or understanding of situations might not always align with objective truths. Additionally, referring to individuals with mental health conditions as \"crazy\" is considered disrespectful and stigmatizing.\n\nIn conclusion, while there is some validity to the idea that children and certain individuals with mental health conditions might speak more candidly, the statement might not fully capture the nuances of truth-telling and could perpetuate stereotypes.

Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that both having an abundance of possessions and having a strong desire for possessions can lead to temptation. This can be interpreted as meaning that wealth can tempt one to become greedy or complacent, while poverty or lack can tempt one to become envious or dishonest in order to acquire what they do not have. This idea aligns with common observations about human behavior and the influence of material wealth on values and actions. It reflects a common understanding that both extremes of wealth and poverty come with their own unique challenges and potential moral pitfalls. Therefore, the statement can be seen as a reflection of common sense about the complexities of human desires and the impact of material circumstances on behavior. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 628, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"Great things should be done without hesitation so that the feeling of danger would not weaken the courage and speed.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement implies that hesitation in taking action on significant tasks can lead to fear and a decrease in effectiveness. In some scenarios, this can be true, as overthinking or delaying decisions can create anxiety and doubt, which may hinder performance. However, the statement overlooks the importance of careful planning and consideration of risks, which are crucial for making informed and effective decisions in many situations.

To evaluate its validity, we can look at various indicators such as income inequality, corruption levels, consumerism, and the pursuit of wealth. Many nations exhibit high levels of these factors, suggesting that greed is indeed a common trait across different societies and cultures. Additionally, globalization and capitalism, which are dominant in the modern world, often incentivize and exacerbate greedy behaviors as individuals and corporations seek to maximize profits and personal gains. Therefore, the statement aligns with observable trends and patterns in global behavior. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 630, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"Greed is a negative character trait.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "Greed is generally considered a negative character trait because it involves an excessive desire for more than what one needs or deserves, especially in terms of wealth or possessions. This can lead to harmful behaviors such as hoarding, exploiting others, or engaging in unethical actions to accumulate more resources. Greed can also damage relationships and contribute to societal inequality and injustice. Most cultures and moral systems discourage greed and promote values such as generosity and contentment. Therefore, the statement aligns with widely held ethical views and social norms.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 631, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"Grief knits two hearts in closer bonds than happiness ever can and common sufferings are far stronger links than common joys.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that shared grief and suffering create deeper connections between people than shared happiness or joy.

Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"Grizzly bears are larger than dogs\" is generally considered common sense because grizzly bears are a species of large bear that typically weigh between 300 to 800 pounds and can stand up to 8 feet tall when on their hind legs. On the other hand, most dog breeds are significantly smaller in size and weight. The average dog weighs between 5 to 150 pounds and stands up to 2.5 feet tall at the shoulder. This significant difference in size and weight between grizzly bears and most dogs is well-known, making the statement align with common sense. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 633, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"Gun laws in the united states should stay within the ambit of the second amendment.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"Gun laws in the United States should stay within the ambit of the Second Amendment\" hinges on the interpretation of the Second Amendment itself, which states that \"the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.\" The scope and limitations of this amendment have been subject to extensive legal and societal debate. On one hand, adhering strictly to the Second Amendment could mean minimal regulation, potentially leading to increased access to firearms, which some argue could result in higher rates of gun violence. On the other hand, proponents argue that it ensures citizens' rights to self-defense and resistance against oppression.\n\nGiven that the Constitution is a living document meant to adapt to changing societal needs, the interpretation of the Second Amendment may evolve. Balancing the original intent of the framers with contemporary issues is crucial. Ensuring public safety while respecting constitutional rights is a complex task that might require gun laws to adapt beyond a strict interpretation of the Second Amendment.\n\nSo the answer is no."}

Statistics show that there are numerous accidental shootings, suicides, and homicides involving firearms each year, which highlights the need for improved gun safety measures and regulations. The urgency implied in the statement aligns with the desire to prevent further unnecessary loss of life and to promote responsible gun ownership. Therefore, recognizing gun safety as a critical issue and calling for action can be considered a matter of public health and safety. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 635, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"Gun violence is a public health crisis.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"Gun violence is a public health crisis\" can be considered common sense when looking at the data and impact of gun-related injuries and deaths. Gun violence not only results in loss of life but also has broader implications for community safety, mental health, and healthcare resources. The prevalence of gun violence and its ripple effects on society contribute to its classification as a public health crisis. It is an issue that requires collective action and intervention to prevent and manage, much like other public health concerns such as infectious diseases or chronic illnesses. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 636, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"Gun violence is not a public health epidemic.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"Gun violence is not a public health epidemic\" can be contested based on evidence and data. Gun violence results in significant loss of life and injury, affecting a large number of people each year. It has ripple effects on mental health, community safety, and overall well-being, similar to other public health issues. The frequency and impact of gun violence in communities, particularly in countries with high rates of firearm-related incidents, indicate that it can be regarded as a public health epidemic. Therefore, considering the data and the broader implications on public health, the statement does not align with the evidence. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 637, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"Gun violence legislation that makes it more difficult for law abiding citizens to protect themselves and their families is not worth passing.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement in question posits that legislation aimed at reducing gun violence should not impede the ability of law-abiding citizens to protect themselves and their families. The reasoning behind this stance could stem from the belief that individuals have a fundamental right to self-defense and that overly restrictive gun laws could leave law-abiding citizens vulnerable. Additionally, some may argue that criminals, who are likely to disregard the law, would still obtain firearms illegally, thus disproportionately affecting those who follow the law.\n\nHowever, it's crucial to consider the broader implications of gun violence legislation. Effective gun control measures can be designed to both prevent firearms from falling into the wrong hands and to allow responsible citizens to retain their ability to defend themselves. The statement assumes a binary choice between personal safety and gun control, which may not necessarily be the case with well-crafted legislation. The complexity of the issue suggests that a careful analysis of proposed laws is necessary to ensure they balance safety with freedom effectively.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 638, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"Guns are very dangerous.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"Guns are very dangerous\" reflects a widely acknowledged fact about the potential harm that firearms can cause when used improperly or in violent circumstances.

{"id": 639, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"Habit is stronger than reason.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"Habit is stronger than reason\" suggests that habitual behaviors and routines often override logical thinking and decision-making. This can be seen in everyday life where people might continue a habit even if it's not the most rational choice, such as smoking or procrastinating. Habits, once formed, create neural pathways in the brain that can be difficult to break, and they often operate on an automatic level, bypassing conscious reasoning. On the other hand, reason requires deliberate thought and effort, which can be more challenging to sustain. Therefore, the influence of ingrained habits can often overpower the application of reason in decision-making processes.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}

Many hair products contain ingredients such as sulfates, parabens, and silicones, which some people may consider unwanted due to potential health and environmental concerns. Additionally, there has been increasing public discourse and media coverage about the ingredients in personal care products, leading to a greater consumer demand for more natural and organic options. However, the perception of what constitutes an \"unwanted chemical\" can vary among individuals, depending on their personal preferences, values, and knowledge about specific ingredients.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 642, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"Happiness would make you want to sing.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"Happiness would make you want to sing\" is based on the general understanding that positive emotions often lead to expressions of joy and celebration, such as singing. Happiness is known to elevate one's mood and energy levels, which can manifest in various forms of creative and expressive outlets, including singing.

{"id": 644, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"Hard work is the basic component of leadership.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"Hard work is the basic component of leadership\" suggests that diligence and effort are fundamental to being an effective leader. This idea aligns with the common understanding that leaders must be dedicated and put in the necessary work to guide and inspire others. Leadership often involves facing challenges, solving problems, and making decisions, all of which require a strong work ethic. Additionally, hard work sets a positive example for team members and helps build trust and respect. Therefore, the notion that hard work is integral to leadership is consistent with the general perception of what it takes to lead successfully.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}

Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "Determining whether the statement \"Harper does not put the people first\" is common sense would depend on the context and evidence available about Harper's actions and policies. If there is substantial evidence showing that Harper consistently prioritizes other interests over the welfare of the people, then it may be considered common sense to those who are familiar with this evidence. However, without specific context or evidence, it is difficult to definitively label the statement as common sense, as it could be viewed as an opinion or assumption.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 646, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"Hate would make you want to destroy your enemy.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"Hate would make you want to destroy your enemy\" suggests that intense feelings of hate can lead to a desire for harm or destruction towards an adversary. Hate is a strong negative emotion that often involves feelings of anger and hostility. When someone feels hatred towards another person, it can sometimes manifest as a desire to see that person suffer or be eliminated as a threat. This psychological response is common as hate can cloud judgment and provoke aggressive actions. However, it is important to note that not everyone reacts the same way to feelings of hate, and it does not always lead to destructive intentions. Nonetheless, the statement aligns with a general understanding of the potential impact of hate on behavior.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 647, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"Hatred is the anger of the weak.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"Hatred is the anger of the weak\" suggests that hatred arises from a position of weakness or vulnerability, rather than strength. This could imply that individuals who resort to hatred may do so because they feel powerless or unable to address their grievances in a constructive manner. This interpretation relies on the idea that strong individuals are more likely to handle conflicts with resilience and understanding, while weaker individuals might succumb to hatred as a defense mechanism.\n\nHowever, the claim that hatred inherently stems from weakness can be overly simplistic. People from various backgrounds and strengths can experience hatred for different reasons. Hatred can also be fueled by factors like fear, prejudice, or past trauma, which are not necessarily tied to personal strength or weakness.\n\nTherefore, while the statement has some merit in highlighting the emotional and psychological dimensions of hatred, it does not comprehensively account for the complexity of human emotions and motivations. So the answer is no."}

Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "Understanding the geography of the world gives us insight into different cultures, environments, and the way people live in various regions. This knowledge can foster empathy and tolerance, as we become more aware of the diversity and challenges faced by others. It can also enhance communication and cooperation on global issues, as we better appreciate the context in which others operate. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 650, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"Having long hair would make you want to have a haircut.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"Having long hair would make you want to have a haircut\" is based on the idea that long hair may become cumbersome or difficult to manage, prompting a desire for a haircut. This assumption might hold true for some people who prefer shorter hair for ease of maintenance, personal style, or comfort. However, this is not universally applicable as others may enjoy or prefer having long hair and have no inclination towards cutting it. Personal preference plays a significant role in this context.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 651, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"Having the help of average americans can keep lobbyists out of politics.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"Having the help of average Americans can keep lobbyists out of politics\" suggests that increased citizen participation in the political process could reduce the influence of lobbyists. The idea is that if more average citizens are engaged and making their voices heard, politicians may be more likely to prioritize the needs and concerns of their constituents over those of lobbyists who represent special interests. Active involvement of citizens can include voting, attending town hall meetings, contacting representatives, and participating in grassroots campaigns, which can create pressure on politicians to be more accountable to the general public rather than to special interest groups. Therefore, the statement aligns with the notion that a robust democratic engagement by the populace can counterbalance the sway of lobbyists.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 652, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"Having the resources to get our message out is critical so we can't rest on that accomplishment.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement emphasizes the importance of continuous effort in spreading a message, even when resources are available. It suggests that having resources alone is not enough; there needs to be ongoing work to effectively utilize those resources and achieve the desired impact. This can be seen as common sense because resources alone do not guarantee success; consistent effort and strategic utilization of resources are necessary to reach and influence the target audience. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 653, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"Having too long hair would make you want to cut your hair.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"Having too long hair would make you want to cut your hair\" is based on the idea that having hair longer than one's personal preference or comfort level may lead to a desire for a change or adjustment. Long hair can become cumbersome, difficult to manage, and may not suit everyone's lifestyle or aesthetic preferences. Consequently, individuals with excessively long hair might be inclined to cut it to a more manageable or desirable length, aligning with their personal comfort and style. Therefore, the statement reflects a logical assumption based on common experiences related to hair maintenance and personal grooming. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 654, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"He must be very ignorant for he answers every question he is asked.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement, \"He must be very ignorant for he answers every question he is asked,\" may at first seem counterintuitive since answering questions is generally associated with knowledge. However, the statement implies that the person answers questions without considering their own limitations or the complexity of the topic, suggesting a lack of awareness or understanding of their own knowledge gaps. True expertise often involves recognizing the limits of one's knowledge and knowing when to say \"I don't know\" or seek more information. Therefore, the statement could be seen as highlighting a type of ignorance related to overconfidence or lack of self-awareness.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 655, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"He offered no solutions because he has none.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"He offered no solutions because he has none\" suggests that the reason for not offering solutions is the lack of having any solutions. This could be considered a logical conclusion because if someone does not possess solutions, they cannot offer them. However, it's also possible that someone might have solutions but chooses not to offer them for various reasons, such as strategic considerations or personal motivations. Therefore, assuming that not offering solutions directly implies not having any may not always hold true in every context. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 656, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"He or she will think logically on what to do.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"He or she will think logically on what to do\" assumes that an individual will approach a situation using logic and rational thought processes. This can be considered common sense because it is generally expected that people will use reasoning and critical thinking to make decisions, especially in situations that require problem-solving. However, it's important to note that not everyone may think logically all the time due to emotional influences, biases, or other factors. Despite these exceptions, the expectation for logical thinking in decision-making is a widely accepted norm. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 657, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"He that is discontented in one place will seldom be content in another.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that an individual's discontentment is more related to their personal outlook or attitude rather than their external circumstances or location. If a person carries a negative mindset or is prone to dissatisfaction, changing locations may not necessarily resolve their discontentment, as their underlying attitude remains the same. This perspective aligns with the psychological understanding that happiness and contentment are significantly influenced by one's internal state and mindset rather than external factors alone. Therefore, the statement reflects a common sense understanding of the relationship between attitude and contentment. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 658, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"He that makes himself an ass must not take it ill if men ride him.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"He that makes himself an ass must not take it ill if men ride him\" implies that if someone behaves foolishly or invites ridicule, they should expect to be treated accordingly. It suggests that people are responsible for their actions and the consequences that follow. This can be seen as common sense as it emphasizes personal accountability and the natural consequences of one's behavior. Therefore, it encourages individuals to consider how their actions might be perceived and the potential repercussions.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 659, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"He that will not sail till all dangers are over must never put to sea.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"He that will not sail till all dangers are over must never put to sea\" implies that waiting for a completely risk-free situation before taking action means never taking action at all, as there will always be some level of risk involved. In the context of sailing, and metaphorically in life, it's impossible to eliminate all dangers or uncertainties. Thus, the statement encourages taking calculated risks and emphasizes the importance of action despite potential obstacles.\n\nThis can be understood as common sense because it recognizes the reality that risks are an inherent part of life and progress. Waiting for a perfect moment, which may never come, can lead to missed opportunities and stagnation. Therefore, it is practical to assess and manage risks rather than avoiding them altogether.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 660, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"He understands the struggles of working americans.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"He understands the struggles of working Americans\" is not necessarily common sense as it is subjective and dependent on context. Understanding the struggles of working Americans requires a certain level of empathy, experience, and awareness of socio-economic issues. Whether or not someone understands these struggles can vary greatly based on their background, experiences, and level of engagement with the working class. Therefore, it is not something that can be assumed as common sense for everyone. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 661, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"He who acts too friendly does not seek your affection but something from you.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that individuals who are excessively friendly may have ulterior motives, rather than genuine affection. While it is possible that some people may act overly friendly to gain something from others, it is not universally true. People can be friendly for various reasons, such as their personality, cultural background, or genuine interest in building relationships. Therefore, generalizing this behavior as always seeking something in return can be an oversimplification and may lead to mistrust in social interactions. \n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 662, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"He who believes in freedom of the will has never loved and never hated.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"He who believes in freedom of the will has never loved and never hated\" suggests that experiencing love or hate negates belief in free will. The reasoning here could be that intense emotions like love and hate can feel overwhelming and uncontrollable, leading one to question the extent of their free will. However, the belief in free will is more about the ability to make conscious choices and decisions, which can still be maintained even when experiencing strong emotions.

It highlights the subjectivity of perspectives and suggests that just because someone thinks a certain way, it does not make their conclusion objectively right or wrong. This concept aligns with the understanding that different people can have varying interpretations and opinions based on their experiences, knowledge, and biases, yet it doesn't definitively establish the truth or falsehood of their stance. Recognizing the distinction between perspective and factual accuracy is essential for critical thinking and constructive discourse.

{"id": 684, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"Human heart only rest after death.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"Human heart only rest after death\" implies that the heart is constantly working throughout a person's lifetime and only ceases to function upon death. In a physiological sense, this is accurate because the heart is responsible for continuously pumping blood throughout the body to deliver oxygen and nutrients and to remove waste products. The heart beats on average 60 to 100 times per minute, and it does not take extended breaks or stop while a person is alive under normal circumstances. The only time the heart truly \"rests,\" or stops beating entirely, is when an individual passes away. Therefore, the statement can be considered a simplification of the heart's relentless activity during a human's life.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}

Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that humans require a religion or belief system to feel anchored and purposeful in life. It is a perspective that many may agree with, as religion and belief systems can provide moral guidance, community, and existential answers that fulfill psychological and emotional needs. However, it is also important to recognize that not everyone relies on religion or specific belief systems to find meaning or stay grounded. Many find purpose and grounding through personal values, philosophy, relationships, or other secular pursuits.\n\nThe idea that humans often need religion or belief system is a common perspective, but it is not universally applicable to everyone. Therefore, while it may be considered common sense to some, it does not hold true as a general rule for all individuals. So the answer is no."}

Hunger is a natural sensation that prompts individuals to seek and consume food in order to replenish energy and maintain bodily functions. It is a survival mechanism ingrained in humans and animals alike. Therefore, the connection between feeling hungry and wanting to eat is straightforward and widely understood.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 689, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"Hunters dressed from head to toe in camouflage clothing makes hunting dangerous as they become hidden in woodland.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement implies that wearing camouflage while hunting makes it dangerous because hunters blend into their surroundings and become less visible to other hunters. The use of camouflage is intended to conceal hunters from their prey, not from other hunters. However, it's important to consider safety measures such as wearing blaze orange along with camouflage to increase visibility to other hunters and reduce the risk of accidents. Most hunting regulations and safety courses emphasize the importance of being visible to other hunters while still being concealed from game. Therefore, the statement overlooks the safety practices commonly followed by responsible hunters.\n\nSo the answer is no."}

It suggests that the primary function of government should be to protect and enhance personal liberty rather than restrict it. This viewpoint aligns with classical liberal principles which emphasize individual rights and limited government intervention.\n\nHowever, whether this statement is considered common sense can vary depending on individual political beliefs, cultural contexts, and interpretations of the role of government.

{"id": 704, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"Ideals would make you want to change society.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"Ideals would make you want to change society\" speaks to the influence of personal beliefs and values on one's desire to effect social change. Ideals represent an individual's vision of what is morally right, just, and desirable. When someone's ideals significantly differ from the current state of society, it is natural for them to desire change in order to align societal conditions with their personal vision. This motivation is often at the core of social movements and reforms. Therefore, the statement aligns with common sense because it reflects the basic human inclination to strive for a society that meets one's ethical and moral standards.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 705, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"Ideas that bring money back into the pockets of those who earned it and who need it the most.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement, \"Ideas that bring money back into the pockets of those who earned it and who need it the most,\" reflects a principle of fairness and economic redistribution. It suggests that resources should be allocated to those who have worked for them and to those who are in greatest need, which can be seen as a way to promote economic equality and social justice. This idea aligns with common sensibilities about fairness and supporting the well-being of individuals in society.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 706, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"Ideas that stop the spread of socialism and lower our healthcare costs while increasing access.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"Ideas that stop the spread of socialism and lower our healthcare costs while increasing access\" is a subjective one that depends on individual political and economic beliefs. Whether or not it is considered common sense can vary based on one's perspective on socialism and healthcare policy. For some, stopping the spread of socialism and finding ways to reduce healthcare costs while increasing access might align with their views on a more market-driven approach to healthcare. For others, who might see socialism as a way to achieve universal healthcare and believe in its principles, the statement might not be common sense. Therefore, the assessment of this statement as common sense is not straightforward and depends on ideological leanings. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 707, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If a developer wants to build a large housing complex in a historical neighborhood its residents have to agree on this.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement reflects the idea of involving residents in decisions that affect their living environment, which is important for maintaining community harmony and preserving the historical integrity of the neighborhood. Involving residents in such decisions can also help ensure that the development aligns with the community's values and needs. However, in practice, the requirement for all residents to agree on a development project may not be feasible, as it can be difficult to achieve unanimous consensus. Local regulations and zoning laws typically guide development projects, and while community input is often considered, it may not be mandatory for all residents to agree.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 708, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If a firework does not burn we should not try to light it again.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If a firework does not burn we should not try to light it again\" is based on safety considerations. Relighting a firework that did not ignite initially can be dangerous, as it may have a defect or malfunction that could cause unpredictable behavior and pose a risk of injury or fire. Additionally, approaching a firework that has not gone off can be hazardous as it may still ignite unexpectedly. Therefore, it is prudent to follow safety guidelines and not attempt to relight a firework that did not work the first time. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 709, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If a flea had money it would buy its own dog.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If a flea had money it would buy its own dog\" is not meant to be taken literally. It is a humorous and hypothetical statement that plays on the idea that fleas depend on dogs for survival, as they feed on their blood. The statement suggests that if fleas had the means (money), they would ensure their own survival by securing a host (dog). It's a playful way to consider the dependency relationship from the flea's perspective.\n\nHowever, in terms of common sense and practicality, the statement is not realistic. Fleas are insects and do not have the cognitive abilities or societal structures to use money or make purchases. The statement is more of a figurative expression rather than one grounded in common sense. \n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 710, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If a fool holds the cow by her horns a clever man can milk her.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If a fool holds the cow by her horns a clever man can milk her\" metaphorically suggests that even in a situation where someone inexperienced or unwise is handling a task, a skilled or intelligent person can still make use of the opportunity to achieve a positive outcome. It emphasizes the idea of leveraging the abilities of others and making the best out of a situation, even if not all parties involved are equally capable. The core message is about resourcefulness and opportunism in the face of less-than-ideal circumstances. \n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 711, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If a man does not make new acquaintances as he advances through life he will soon find himself alone a man should keep his friendships in constant repair.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement emphasizes the importance of continually nurturing and expanding one's social connections as one progresses through life. It suggests that without making new acquaintances and maintaining existing friendships, a person risks becoming isolated. Social connections are important for emotional support, personal growth, and overall well-being. It is generally understood that relationships require effort and attention to remain strong and meaningful. Therefore, the statement reflects a common-sense approach to maintaining a healthy social life as one ages. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 712, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If a person adopts a dog and doesn't care for the dog.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If a person adopts a dog and doesn't care for the dog\" implies a lack of responsibility and neglect towards the dog's well-being. Common sense dictates that when someone chooses to adopt a dog, they should also commit to providing the necessary care, attention, and resources the dog needs to live a healthy and happy life. Neglecting these responsibilities can lead to harm or suffering for the animal, which is generally understood to be unethical and sometimes illegal. Therefore, the statement aligns with common sense as it highlights an expected standard of care that should be met when adopting a dog. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 713, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If a person adopts a dog he adopts the dog because he has no children.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If a person adopts a dog he adopts the dog because he has no children\" is not necessarily accurate or common sense. People adopt dogs for a variety of reasons, including companionship, emotional support, and a love for animals. Having children or not is not the sole determinant for adopting a dog. Many families with children also adopt dogs to provide their children with a pet or to teach them responsibility. Therefore, the statement is too generalized and does not account for the diverse motivations behind why people choose to adopt dogs. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 714, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If a person adopts a dog he cannot take bone from it.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If a person adopts a dog he cannot take bone from it\" may not be common sense as it depends on the context in which it is interpreted. If it refers to physically taking a bone away from a dog while it is eating, it may be considered common sense to avoid doing so in order to prevent provoking the dog or causing distress. However, if it refers to owning bones or providing bones to the dog, it does not make sense as dog owners often provide bones for their pets as treats or for dental health. Therefore, the interpretation of the statement influences whether or not it aligns with common sense.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 715, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If a person adopts a dog it will destory their livehood.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If a person adopts a dog it will destroy their livelihood\" is an exaggerated and generalized claim that does not take into account individual circumstances and experiences. Many people who adopt dogs find that they bring joy, companionship, and even therapeutic benefits. While it's true that owning a dog comes with responsibilities and potential challenges, such as financial costs and time commitments, these do not necessarily equate to the destruction of one's livelihood. Additionally, proper planning, training, and care can mitigate many of the potential challenges associated with dog ownership. Therefore, the statement lacks nuance and does not reflect the varied experiences of dog owners. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 716, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If a person adopts a dog they can let it run amok.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If a person adopts a dog they can let it run amok\" is not aligned with common sense. When a person adopts a dog, they take on the responsibility of providing proper care, training, and ensuring the dog follows rules and regulations for the safety of the dog and others. Letting a dog run amok can lead to dangerous situations, such as the dog getting lost, causing accidents, or hurting other animals or people. Responsible pet ownership involves setting boundaries and teaching appropriate behavior.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 717, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If a person adopts a dog they hate all animals.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If a person adopts a dog they hate all animals\" does not hold up to common sense reasoning. Typically, adopting a dog suggests that a person has affection and care for animals, as they are willing to take responsibility for the well-being of a dog. It would be contradictory to suggest that this same person hates all animals when they are demonstrating compassion towards at least one animal. Therefore, the statement is illogical and does not align with common sense.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 718, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If a person adopts a dog they should dye the dog's hair all pink to make it stand out.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "Dyeing a dog's hair pink may not be a practical or necessary action for everyone who adopts a dog. The primary concern should be the dog's welfare, comfort, and health. Using dyes could potentially cause skin irritation or allergic reactions in dogs. Additionally, the decision to dye a dog's hair should consider the dog's well-being rather than just making it stand out for aesthetic reasons. Therefore, the statement does not align with common sense as it prioritizes appearance over the animal's health and comfort.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 719, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If a person adopts a dog they will set it free.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If a person adopts a dog they will set it free\" is not common sense because the general understanding of adopting a dog is to provide it with a safe and loving home, not to release it back into the wild or abandon it. When people adopt dogs, they usually intend to take on the responsibility of caring for the animal and ensuring its well-being, which includes keeping it under their guardianship and not setting it free. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 720, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If a person conducts research they would document every bit of information they learn.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If a person conducts research they would document every bit of information they learn\" suggests that researchers meticulously record all data or insights they encounter during their research process. While it is common practice for researchers to document important and relevant information, capturing \"every bit\" of information may not be practical or necessary. Researchers often focus on recording data pertinent to their specific research questions or hypotheses and may disregard extraneous information. Additionally, the vast amount of data that can be encountered in some fields may make it impractical or even impossible to document everything.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 721, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If a person digs themselves into a hole after digging themselves out.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If a person digs themselves into a hole after digging themselves out\" seems contradictory because it suggests that a person is repeating a mistake or a futile action. The phrase \"digging oneself into a hole\" is often used metaphorically to describe getting into a difficult or problematic situation. If a person has already dug themselves out of a hole, it implies they have resolved or escaped the situation. Repeating the action of digging into a hole suggests a lack of learning from past experiences or a cycle of creating the same problems.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 722, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If a person digs themselves into a hole he is content about the situation.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If a person digs themselves into a hole he is content about the situation\" suggests that being in a difficult or problematic situation is desirable or satisfying. Generally, digging oneself into a hole is used as a metaphor for getting into a difficult or unfavorable situation. It is not common for people to be content or happy about being in a problematic situation. Most individuals strive to avoid or resolve difficulties rather than being content with them. Therefore, the statement does not align with typical human behavior or common sense.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 723, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If a person digs themselves into a hole they can fall into it.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If a person digs themselves into a hole they can fall into it\" can be understood both literally and metaphorically. Literally, if someone physically digs a hole in the ground, they can indeed fall into it if they are not careful. Metaphorically, the statement suggests that if someone creates a difficult or problematic situation for themselves, they may face negative consequences as a result. In both interpretations, the idea that actions have consequences is a basic concept of cause and effect, which is generally considered common sense. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 724, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If a person digs themselves into a hole they probably feel successful.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If a person digs themselves into a hole they probably feel successful\" may not necessarily align with common sense. The phrase \"digging oneself into a hole\" typically implies getting into a difficult or problematic situation, rather than achieving success. Success is generally associated with positive outcomes and accomplishments, not with being stuck or trapped. Therefore, feeling successful as a result of digging oneself into a hole seems counterintuitive.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 725, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If a person digs themselves into a hole they probably just wanted to be alone for a while.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If a person digs themselves into a hole they probably just wanted to be alone for a while\" is a metaphorical expression suggesting that someone who isolates themselves or gets into a difficult situation may have done so intentionally to seek solitude or escape from others. It is not necessarily common sense, as there could be various reasons why someone ends up in a tough situation or withdraws from others, such as stress, mental health issues, or external pressures, which may not be related to a desire for solitude. This statement oversimplifies complex human behavior and motivations. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 726, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If a person digs themselves into a hole they should be able to swim out.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If a person digs themselves into a hole they should be able to swim out\" is not common sense, as it mixes metaphors and does not align with logical reasoning. Digging a hole suggests removing dirt or material to create a cavity in the ground, which has no relation to swimming, an activity performed in water. Therefore, the expectation to swim out of a hole dug in the ground is not sensibly sound. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 727, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If a person digs themselves into a hole they should wait for it to rain so they can float to the top.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If a person digs themselves into a hole they should wait for it to rain so they can float to the top\" is not based on common sense. Physically, rainwater would not typically fill a hole sufficiently or quickly enough to allow a person to float to the top. Additionally, depending on the depth and size of the hole, waiting for rain could be impractical or dangerous. It is more sensible to find other means of getting out of the hole, such as using a ladder or seeking help. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 728, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If a person digs themselves into a hole they will be in a bad mood.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If a person digs themselves into a hole they will be in a bad mood\" can be interpreted metaphorically, referring to someone who has gotten themselves into a difficult or problematic situation. In such cases, it is common for people to experience feelings of frustration, stress, or disappointment, which could lead to a bad mood. Therefore, it can be considered common sense that facing challenging circumstances as a result of one's own actions could negatively impact one's mood. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 729, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If a person digs themselves into a hole they will want to keep digging.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If a person digs themselves into a hole they will want to keep digging\" can be interpreted metaphorically to suggest that when a person finds themselves in a difficult situation, they might continue making poor decisions that exacerbate the problem. This may happen due to a variety of psychological factors such as sunk cost fallacy, stubbornness, or the hope that continued efforts might eventually lead to a solution. However, it's not universally true that everyone reacts this way in challenging circumstances; some might choose to stop, reassess, and change their approach. Therefore, the statement is not necessarily common sense as it doesn't apply universally to all individuals in all situations. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 730, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If a person flies across the room they would win the race faster than expected.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If a person flies across the room they would win the race faster than expected\" implies that flying would provide an unusual advantage in speed compared to typical methods of racing, such as running. In most cases, flying would indeed be faster than running, assuming it is physically possible for a human to do so in this context. Therefore, it makes sense that flying would lead to winning a race more quickly than anticipated under normal circumstances where flying is not an option. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 731, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If a person gather all the ingredients then they want to do the recipes.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If a person gathers all the ingredients then they want to do the recipes\" suggests that the act of gathering ingredients implies a desire to follow through with cooking or baking the recipes that require those ingredients. This can generally be seen as common sense, as it is logical to assume that if someone takes the time and effort to collect specific ingredients, they have an intention to use them in accordance with a recipe. However, there could be exceptions where someone gathers ingredients for other purposes, such as for stocking up or for giving them to someone else. Despite these exceptions, the typical scenario aligns with the statement.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 732, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If a person gets on a crowded train he will definitely miss out.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If a person gets on a crowded train he will definitely miss out\" is not necessarily common sense because it lacks context and is not universally true. The idea of \"missing out\" could refer to missing out on a seat, personal space, or comfort, but it does not mean that the person will miss out on reaching their destination or other opportunities. Crowded trains are a common occurrence in many cities and are still a reliable means of transportation for many people. The statement makes an assumption without considering various factors such as the urgency of travel, the availability of other transportation options, or the personal tolerance for crowded spaces.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 733, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If a person gets on a crowded train is that their fault or the fault of the people around them who overfilled it is that their fault.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement poses a question about fault and responsibility when it comes to a crowded train situation. Fault implies blame for a negative outcome. In this scenario, the person getting on the train is making a choice to enter a crowded space, and those already on the train may not have control over the number of people boarding. Public transportation systems are designed to accommodate multiple passengers, and crowding can be a common occurrence during peak hours. It is not necessarily anyone's \"fault\" as it is a result of the system's capacity and the collective need for transportation at that time. Hence, attributing fault may not be the most constructive perspective. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 734, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If a person gets on a crowded train there will be many seats available.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If a person gets on a crowded train there will be many seats available\" does not align with common sense. By definition, a crowded train implies that there is a high number of passengers, which would naturally lead to fewer available seats. The assertion that there would be many seats available contradicts the initial premise of the train being crowded. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 735, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If a person gets on a crowded train they are doing so to get over their fear of people.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement, \"If a person gets on a crowded train they are doing so to get over their fear of people,\" does not necessarily hold true for all individuals. People may board crowded trains for various reasons, such as commuting to work, traveling to a specific destination, or because it is the only available option at the time. The assumption that the primary motivation is to overcome a fear of people overlooks these other possibilities and oversimplifies human behavior. Therefore, the statement is not a reflection of common sense, as it does not consider the diverse motivations behind people's actions.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 736, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If a person gets on a crowded train they can get very drunk.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If a person gets on a crowded train they can get very drunk\" does not necessarily follow common sense. Getting on a crowded train and getting drunk are two unrelated actions. Being on a crowded train does not inherently lead to or cause drunkenness, as it depends on whether the person chooses to consume alcohol. The crowded train environment itself does not facilitate or encourage drunkenness. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 737, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If a person gets on a crowded train they sit on someone's lap.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If a person gets on a crowded train they sit on someone's lap\" is not reflective of common sense. Common sense suggests that individuals would first look for available seats or stand if no seats are available. Sitting on someone's lap would generally be considered inappropriate and uncomfortable in public settings like a train, unless there is a prior relationship or consent between the individuals involved. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 738, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If a person gets on a crowded train they will immediately get off.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If a person gets on a crowded train they will immediately get off\" does not necessarily align with common sense. People board crowded trains frequently, especially during peak hours in urban areas where public transportation is heavily utilized. The decision to stay on or get off a crowded train would depend on various factors such as the urgency of reaching the destination, the availability of alternative transportation, and personal tolerance for crowded spaces. It is not a universally applicable rule that a person will immediately get off a crowded train upon boarding. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 739, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If a person gets on a crowded train they will need to hold on tight and probably should have gotten inside the train rather than on it.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement implies that a person should be inside the train rather than on it for safety reasons, which aligns with common sense as riding on the exterior of a train is dangerous and not intended for passengers. Holding on tight on a crowded train is also sensible advice to maintain balance and safety. Therefore, the statement reflects practical and reasonable considerations for personal safety in the context of train travel.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 740, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If a person gets on a crowded train they yell fire to clear out the crowd.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If a person gets on a crowded train they yell fire to clear out the crowd\" is not common sense. Yelling fire in a crowded space can cause panic, chaos, and potentially put people in danger. It is not a considerate or responsible way to handle the situation. Additionally, it is illegal in many places to falsely yell fire as it can lead to unnecessary emergency responses and public disturbance. Common sense would suggest finding alternative, safer ways to deal with a crowded train, such as waiting for the next train or moving to a less crowded area. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 741, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If a person gets on an empty train and stood up instead of sitting.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement describes a scenario where a person chooses to stand on an empty train instead of sitting down. While it is not uncommon for someone to stand on public transportation, it is unusual for a person to stand when there are plenty of available seats, especially if the train is empty. Common sense would suggest that a person would take advantage of the opportunity to sit down and be comfortable, especially if there are no obstacles to doing so. However, the person might have personal reasons or preferences for standing, such as wanting to stretch their legs or avoid sitting for health reasons. Therefore, the statement itself is not necessarily contrary to common sense, as it depends on the individual's specific circumstances or preferences.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 742, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If a person gets on an empty train he is hijacked the train.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If a person gets on an empty train he is hijacked the train\" does not align with common sense. The act of getting on an empty train does not necessarily equate to hijacking. Hijacking involves unlawfully seizing control of a vehicle with the use of force or threats, typically to achieve a particular aim. Simply boarding an empty train does not meet these criteria unless additional actions are taken to unlawfully seize control. Therefore, the statement lacks logical consistency with the definition and understanding of hijacking.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 743, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If a person gets on an empty train he would be in no mans land.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If a person gets on an empty train he would be in no man's land\" can be interpreted metaphorically rather than literally. \"No man's land\" typically refers to an unoccupied or disputed area between territories, but in this context, it seems to suggest a place of isolation or loneliness due to the lack of other passengers. It appears to convey the idea of being physically alone on the train, not necessarily being in a geographic or legal \"no man's land.\" Since the statement is more figurative than based on actual geographical implications, it might not align with the common understanding of \"no man's land.\" Hence, it's not directly related to common sense which is typically grounded in practical and logical reasoning based on everyday experiences.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 744, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If a person gets on an empty train he would hear lots of people talking.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If a person gets on an empty train he would hear lots of people talking\" contradicts itself because it starts by describing the train as empty, implying no other passengers are present. If there are no other passengers, there would be no one to talk, and therefore no sounds of people talking would be heard. This statement does not align with common sense because it is logically inconsistent.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 745, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If a person gets on an empty train it means all the other passengers are hiding.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If a person gets on an empty train it means all the other passengers are hiding\" is not common sense. Common sense would suggest that if a person gets on an empty train, it simply means there are no other passengers on the train at that time. The idea that other passengers are hiding is an illogical and unlikely assumption without any evidence or typical reasoning to support it. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 746, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If a person gets on an empty train that person will stand instead of sit.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If a person gets on an empty train that person will stand instead of sit\" does not align with common sense. Typically, when a person encounters an empty train with available seating, the most logical and comfortable choice would be to sit down rather than stand. Standing when there are ample seats available would be an unusual behavior for most people, as sitting is generally more comfortable and requires less effort, especially during a potentially long train ride.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 747, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If a person gets on an empty train then it's a ghost train that no one else can see.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement, \"If a person gets on an empty train then it's a ghost train that no one else can see,\" does not align with common sense. Common sense suggests that trains, whether empty or full, are physical objects that are visible to everyone who is present. An empty train could simply mean that there are no passengers at that particular time or on that specific route, but it does not imply that the train becomes invisible or supernatural. The idea of a \"ghost train\" is more aligned with supernatural or fictional concepts rather than reality and everyday logic. \n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 748, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If a person gets on an empty train they have a ticket to ride a plane.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If a person gets on an empty train they have a ticket to ride a plane\" does not logically follow common sense as trains and planes are two different modes of transportation, each requiring separate tickets. Boarding a train does not inherently provide evidence or indication that a person has a ticket for a plane ride. Therefore, the connection between getting on a train and having a plane ticket is not justified by common sense.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 749, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If a person gets on an empty train they lay down on the floor.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If a person gets on an empty train they lay down on the floor\" does not align with common sense. Generally, when people board a train, whether empty or full, they sit on the seats provided for comfort and safety, rather than lying on the floor. Laying on the floor of a train is unconventional and may be seen as unhygienic or unsafe. Therefore, this behavior is not what one would typically expect in such a scenario. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 750, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If a person has a great boss he cannot be singing at work.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If a person has a great boss he cannot be singing at work\" does not necessarily align with common sense. A great boss can create a positive and encouraging work environment, which might include allowing employees to express themselves and enjoy their work, potentially even through singing. The statement seems to impose an arbitrary restriction that does not logically follow from having a great boss. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 751, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If a person has a great boss he will earn that boss by cheating.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If a person has a great boss he will earn that boss by cheating\" suggests that achieving a good working relationship with a superior requires dishonest behavior. This idea undermines the values of integrity, hard work, and meritocracy that are commonly upheld in professional environments. It is not common sense to assume that cheating is necessary or acceptable to earn the respect or approval of a great boss. Healthy professional relationships are typically built on trust, mutual respect, and ethical behavior. Therefore, the notion that cheating is required to earn a great boss is not aligned with common sense.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 752, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If a person has a great boss he would have you work overtime without compensation.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If a person has a great boss he would have you work overtime without compensation\" contradicts common expectations of what a great boss would do. Generally, a great boss is expected to be fair, ethical and respectful of their employees' time and labor rights. Having employees work overtime without compensation is typically viewed as exploitative and unfair, which goes against the qualities of a great boss. Therefore, the statement does not align with the common understanding of a great boss.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 753, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If a person has a great boss i would quit the job and looks for a bad boss.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If a person has a great boss I would quit the job and look for a bad boss\" does not align with common sense. Typically, having a great boss is considered a positive aspect of a job, as it can lead to a supportive work environment, opportunities for growth, and job satisfaction. Conversely, a bad boss can create a hostile work environment, hinder professional development, and decrease job satisfaction. Therefore, it is not logical to quit a job with a great boss in search of a job with a bad boss. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 754, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If a person has a great boss it's because their boss is an alien.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If a person has a great boss it's because their boss is an alien\" is not based on common sense. Common sense suggests that a great boss is characterized by qualities such as strong leadership, effective communication, empathy, and fairness, which are all human traits. The statement unrealistically attributes these positive qualities to being an alien, which lacks logical or factual basis. Additionally, there is no evidence to support the idea that aliens exist, let alone hold management positions. Therefore, the statement is not grounded in reality or common sense.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 755, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If a person has a great boss they can jump on their desk.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If a person has a great boss they can jump on their desk\" does not necessarily follow common sense principles. A great boss typically refers to qualities such as leadership, support, and fairness, rather than permissiveness towards unprofessional behavior like jumping on desks. Workplace etiquette and safety standards generally discourage such actions, regardless of the quality of the boss. Therefore, having a great boss does not automatically imply that it is acceptable to jump on a desk.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 756, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If a person has a great boss they might want find a different supervisor.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If a person has a great boss they might want to find a different supervisor\" seems counterintuitive. Generally, having a great boss is considered a positive aspect of a job, as a good supervisor can provide support, guidance, and opportunities for growth. If an employee is satisfied with their boss, they are more likely to feel content and motivated in their current position, reducing the likelihood of seeking a change in supervision. Therefore, it is not common sense to suggest that a person with a great boss might want to find a different supervisor. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 757, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If a person has a great boss they quit for a lower paying job.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If a person has a great boss they quit for a lower paying job\" suggests that having a good manager would be a reason for someone to leave a job for one with less pay. However, common sense and research on job satisfaction typically indicate that having a supportive and effective boss is a key factor in employee retention and job satisfaction. A great boss can contribute to a positive work environment, opportunities for professional growth, and overall job fulfillment, which are usually reasons for employees to stay rather than leave. Therefore, it would be unusual for someone to quit a job with a great boss for a lower-paying position unless there are other compelling personal or professional reasons.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 758, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If a person has a great boss they usually appreciate all their co workers because they know they can count on their teammate to.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that having a great boss leads to appreciation of co-workers, due to the ability to rely on teammates. While a positive work environment fostered by a good leader could contribute to better teamwork and mutual appreciation, it is not guaranteed that appreciation for all co-workers will naturally follow from having a great boss alone. Individual relationships and dynamics between co-workers can vary, and not all appreciation stems solely from reliability or leadership influence. Therefore, the statement oversimplifies the complexities of workplace relationships.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 759, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If a person has a great boss they're more likely to get fired.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If a person has a great boss they're more likely to get fired\" does not align with common sense. Generally, a great boss would be supportive, fair, and effective in managing their team. This type of leadership tends to foster a positive work environment, enhance employee performance, and increase job satisfaction. Consequently, employees under a great boss are more likely to be motivated, engaged, and productive, reducing the likelihood of them being fired. Therefore, the statement contradicts the typical outcomes associated with having a great boss. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 760, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If a person is a freshman in college they would ask their parents to drive them and pick them up from school.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If a person is a freshman in college they would ask their parents to drive them and pick them up from school\" does not necessarily hold true as common sense. College freshmen have various transportation options available to them, including public transportation, walking, biking, carpooling with peers, or driving themselves if they have access to a vehicle. Additionally, many colleges are located in urban areas where driving may not be practical or necessary. The assumption that freshmen would rely solely on their parents for transportation may not accurately reflect the independence and diverse circumstances of college students. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 761, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If a person is driving their car on the highway they are going 30 mph over the speed limit.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement, \"If a person is driving their car on the highway they are going 30 mph over the speed limit,\" does not necessarily hold true as common sense. Driving behavior varies widely among individuals, and speed limits are established and posted to inform drivers of the legal maximum speed they can travel in a given area. While some drivers may exceed the speed limit, others may adhere to it or even drive below it for various reasons such as road conditions, traffic, or personal preference for safety. The statement makes a sweeping generalization that does not account for the diversity of driving behaviors and does not represent a universally accepted truth or common sense. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 762, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If a person is feeling a little cold and his lips are pale you might want to keep your sleeves down or put on a sweater or a jacket.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that if a person is feeling cold and has pale lips, others around them might want to cover up as well. This advice is based on the assumption that if one person is feeling cold, the surrounding environment might be cold too, and therefore it would be sensible for others to also wear warmer clothing to stay comfortable. However, the part about pale lips may not necessarily indicate coldness as it could be a sign of other health issues. The core advice to dress warmly in a cold environment is reasonable, but linking it specifically to another person's pale lips may not be a reliable indicator.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 763, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If a person is feeling a little cold he cant wear sleaveless clothes.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If a person is feeling a little cold he can't wear sleeveless clothes\" is based on the idea that sleeveless clothes do not provide warmth to the arms and shoulders, which could potentially make a person feel colder. Generally, when people feel cold, they tend to wear clothes that cover more of their body to help retain heat. Therefore, it is common sense to choose clothing that provides more coverage and warmth when feeling cold.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 764, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If a person is feeling a little cold he would be sweating.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If a person is feeling a little cold he would be sweating\" does not align with common sense or typical physiological responses. When a person feels cold, the body usually tries to conserve heat, not dissipate it. Sweating is a mechanism the body uses to cool down when it is overheated. Feeling cold typically triggers responses such as shivering, which helps generate heat, rather than sweating. Therefore, the statement contradicts the usual bodily responses to feeling cold. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 765, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If a person is feeling a little cold is alright.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If a person is feeling a little cold is alright\" suggests that experiencing mild cold is generally acceptable and not a cause for concern. This can be considered common sense because feeling a little cold is a normal human sensation and usually doesn't indicate a serious problem. It can often be easily remedied by adding layers of clothing or adjusting the environment's temperature. It's important to recognize that mild cold sensations are a part of everyday life and do not typically require medical attention unless accompanied by other symptoms. Therefore, it is reasonable to believe that feeling slightly cold is generally alright. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 766, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If a person is feeling a little cold it is because they are in the vacuum of space.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If a person is feeling a little cold it is because they are in the vacuum of space\" is not common sense. Feeling a little cold can happen in many everyday situations such as being in a room with air conditioning, being outside in cool weather, or even sitting near a drafty window. The vacuum of space is an extreme and hostile environment where exposure would lead to immediate and severe consequences beyond just feeling a little cold, including lack of oxygen and exposure to cosmic radiation. Therefore, feeling a little cold is not a typical or exclusive indicator of being in the vacuum of space. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 767, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If a person is feeling a little cold maybe they have too much clothing on.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If a person is feeling a little cold maybe they have too much clothing on\" contradicts common sense, as typically when someone feels cold, it suggests they may need more insulation or clothing to retain body heat, not less. Feeling cold generally indicates that the body is losing heat to the environment, and adding layers helps to trap heat and keep the body warm. Removing clothing would likely exacerbate the feeling of coldness. Therefore, the statement does not align with typical understanding of how to respond to feeling cold. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 768, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If a person is feeling a little cold that person will eat a cold ice cream.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If a person is feeling a little cold that person will eat a cold ice cream\" is not common sense. Typically, when a person feels cold, they seek warmth and comfort, and consuming cold foods like ice cream may not be the most intuitive choice. People generally prefer hot beverages or food that can help raise their body temperature. Therefore, the statement contradicts what is typically expected in such a situation. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 769, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If a person is feeling a little cold they might want to eat some ice cream.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If a person is feeling a little cold they might want to eat some ice cream\" is not common sense. Typically, when a person feels cold, they seek warmth and comfort, and consuming cold foods like ice cream may not be the most intuitive choice. People generally prefer hot beverages or food that can help raise their body temperature. Ice cream, being cold and frozen, might exacerbate the feeling of coldness rather than alleviate it. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 770, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If a person is feeling a little cold they need some iced tea.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If a person is feeling a little cold they need some iced tea\" does not align with common sense. Typically, when someone is feeling cold, they would seek something warm to help raise their body temperature and feel more comfortable, such as hot tea or coffee. Iced tea, being cold, would likely exacerbate the feeling of coldness rather than alleviate it. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 771, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If a person is feeling a little cold they should get a blood transfusion to replace their blood with antifreeze.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement is not common sense. Replacing human blood with antifreeze is not a medically sound or safe practice. Antifreeze is a chemical used in vehicles to prevent freezing and is toxic to humans. It can cause serious harm or death if introduced into the human bloodstream. When a person feels cold, appropriate measures include wearing warmer clothing, using blankets, or adjusting the temperature indoors. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 772, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If a person is feeling a little hot and tired then yes thats your hormones regulating.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If a person is feeling a little hot and tired then yes that's your hormones regulating\" suggests that hormones are responsible for these sensations. While hormones can indeed play a role in body temperature regulation and energy levels, feeling hot and tired can also be attributed to a variety of other factors such as dehydration, physical exertion, environmental conditions, or illness. Therefore, it is an oversimplification to attribute these feelings solely to hormonal regulation without considering other potential causes. \n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 773, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If a person is feeling a little hot he is coming from the desert.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If a person is feeling a little hot he is coming from the desert\" is not necessarily common sense. Feeling hot can be influenced by various factors such as the weather, physical activity, or even health conditions and does not exclusively indicate that a person has been in the desert. The desert is just one of many possible locations where someone might feel hot, and it's not a definitive or sole indicator. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 774, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If a person is feeling a little hot he should do away with fire.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If a person is feeling a little hot he should do away with fire\" suggests that eliminating sources of heat, such as fire, can help reduce a person's body temperature. While it makes sense to avoid direct sources of heat if feeling hot, the use of the word \"fire\" seems overly specific and drastic in most everyday contexts. In modern settings, people typically rely on adjusting air conditioning, using fans, or changing their clothing to cool down, rather than directly dealing with fire. Thus, the statement might not be applicable or practical in typical scenarios.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 775, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If a person is feeling a little hot that person will breath fire.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If a person is feeling a little hot that person will breath fire\" is not aligned with common sense or scientific understanding of human physiology. When a person feels hot, it is typically due to external temperature, physical exertion, or a physiological response such as a fever. However, breathing fire is not a natural or possible response for humans; it is a fantastical element often seen in myths or fictional stories, not grounded in reality. Therefore, the statement contradicts basic biological principles and is not supported by empirical evidence. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 776, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If a person is feeling a little hot they might want to move away from the fireplace.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement is based on the understanding that fireplaces generate heat. If a person is already feeling hot, moving away from the heat source would help them cool down and feel more comfortable. This aligns with basic principles of thermoregulation in humans and common knowledge about sources of heat. Therefore, the statement can be considered as common sense. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 777, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If a person is feeling a little hot they should go relax in a suana.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If a person is feeling a little hot they should go relax in a sauna\" does not align with common sense. A sauna is designed to increase body temperature and induce sweating through exposure to high heat and steam. If a person is already feeling hot, spending time in a sauna would likely exacerbate their discomfort and could potentially lead to overheating or heat-related illnesses. Instead, it would be more sensible to seek a cooler environment to help regulate body temperature. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 778, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If a person is feeling a little hot they should put on more clothing.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If a person is feeling a little hot they should put on more clothing\" does not align with common sense. Typically, when someone feels hot, the natural response is to remove layers or wear lighter clothing to help cool down, not to add more clothing which would likely increase their body temperature. The logic of the statement contradicts general understanding of how to regulate body temperature in response to feeling hot.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 779, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If a person is feeling a little hot they will want to be around others.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If a person is feeling a little hot they will want to be around others\" does not necessarily align with common sense. When someone is feeling hot, their primary concern is likely to cool down, and being around others could generate more body heat and make the situation less comfortable. People might seek out ways to cool off, such as moving to a shaded or air-conditioned area, rather than seeking out the company of others. Therefore, the desire to be around others when feeling hot is not a typical or automatic response. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 780, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If a person is leaving a fast food store with a bag a person didn't pay for their order.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement, \"If a person is leaving a fast food store with a bag a person didn't pay for their order,\" does not necessarily imply common sense. It assumes that everyone leaving with a bag has not paid, which overlooks various possibilities such as pre-payment through online orders, payment made through mobile apps, or someone else having paid on their behalf. Additionally, it assumes theft without considering legitimate scenarios. Common sense would suggest not jumping to conclusions without sufficient evidence of the payment process.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 781, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If a person is leaving a fast food store with a bag employees.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If a person is leaving a fast food store with a bag employees\" is incomplete and unclear, making it difficult to determine whether it represents common sense. The phrasing is awkward and seems to be missing key information, such as what the person with the bag is doing or what is significant about the employees in relation to the bag. Without more context or clarification, it's hard to assess whether this statement is based on common sense. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 782, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If a person is leaving a fast food store with a bag from walmart.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If a person is leaving a fast food store with a bag from Walmart\" suggests that the person has been shopping at Walmart and then visited a fast food store. It is common for people to run multiple errands in one trip, so it is possible for someone to have a Walmart bag while leaving a fast food store. However, the statement itself does not provide enough information to determine whether this scenario is common or not. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 783, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If a person is leaving a fast food store with a bag he is leaving something in that store.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that if a person is leaving a fast food store with a bag, they are simultaneously leaving something behind in the store. This seems contradictory, as typically when a person leaves with a bag from a fast food store, it implies they have purchased and are taking items (such as food) with them, rather than leaving items behind. The statement could be interpreted as metaphorical, implying the person is leaving trash or packaging, but in a literal sense, the statement is not aligned with common sense. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 784, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If a person is leaving a fast food store with a bag he shouldnt be twerking.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that twerking, a type of dance characterized by vigorous hip movements, may not be an appropriate activity when leaving a fast food store, perhaps due to the public setting and the context of carrying food. This can be seen as a matter of etiquette and social norms, where certain behaviors are expected in specific environments. Since fast food stores are generally public and family-friendly places, engaging in a dance associated with nightclubs and parties might be deemed inappropriate by some.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 785, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If a person is leaving a fast food store with a bag it might contain money from a robbery.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that a person leaving a fast food store with a bag might be involved in a robbery, which is an assumption based on limited information. It's more common for people to leave fast food stores with bags containing food, as that is the primary purpose of such establishments. Without additional context or evidence suggesting a robbery, it's not reasonable to assume that a bag from a fast food store contains stolen money. Common sense would dictate that the bag most likely contains food items. \n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 786, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If a person is leaving a fast food store with a bag that person did not like the food offered.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement, \"If a person is leaving a fast food store with a bag that person did not like the food offered,\" does not necessarily follow common sense. Leaving a fast food store with a bag usually indicates that a person has purchased food items from the store. The act of purchasing food suggests that the person either likes the food or is willing to consume it for other reasons such as convenience or affordability. The statement assumes a negative preference without considering other factors that could influence the decision to buy food. Therefore, it is not a reasonable or common-sense conclusion to draw from the observation of someone leaving with a bag of food.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 787, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If a person is leaving a fast food store with a bag they intend to prowl the sewers looking for their pet crocodile.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "This statement does not seem to be based on common sense. Common sense would suggest that if a person is leaving a fast food store with a bag, they most likely purchased food and intend to eat it. The idea of prowling sewers for a pet crocodile is an unusual and unlikely scenario that does not logically follow from the premise of someone leaving a fast food store with a bag. Additionally, crocodiles are not common pets and are unlikely to be found in sewers. Therefore, the statement lacks a reasonable or logical connection. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 788, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If a person is leaving a fast food store with a bag they just got their dry cleaning back.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement does not align with common sense because fast food stores primarily serve food, and dry cleaning services handle clothing and fabric cleaning. The two services are unrelated and typically do not operate within the same establishment. Therefore, it would be unusual for a person to retrieve dry cleaning from a fast food store. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 789, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If a person is leaving a fast food store with a bag they must not be hungry.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If a person is leaving a fast food store with a bag they must not be hungry\" assumes that the person has already eaten the food they purchased, or that buying food indicates they are no longer hungry. However, it is possible that the person bought the food to eat later, or that they are buying food for someone else. Therefore, we cannot definitively conclude that a person is not hungry just because they are leaving a fast food store with a bag. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 790, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If a person is leaving a fast food store with a bag they will throw it away.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If a person is leaving a fast food store with a bag they will throw it away\" is not necessarily common sense because it makes a broad assumption about the person's behavior. People may leave a fast food store with a bag for various reasons, such as taking leftover food home, carrying out an order for someone else, or even reusing the bag for other purposes. The assumption that everyone will throw away the bag is an oversimplification and does not consider the diversity of individual actions and intentions. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 791, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If a person is on a road trip he she would not maintain their vehicle.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If a person is on a road trip he she would not maintain their vehicle\" does not align with common sense. Typically, individuals who are planning to go on a road trip or are currently on one would prioritize maintaining their vehicle to ensure it functions properly and safely throughout the journey. Regular checks and maintenance can prevent breakdowns and other issues that could disrupt the trip. Therefore, it is more likely that a person on a road trip would be attentive to their vehicle's maintenance needs.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 792, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If a person is wearing a swimsuit because he is a madman.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If a person is wearing a swimsuit because he is a madman\" suggests that wearing a swimsuit is an indicator of madness, which is not a logical or common-sense conclusion. People wear swimsuits for many reasons, primarily for swimming or other water-related activities. Wearing a swimsuit does not reflect on a person's mental health. The statement makes an unfounded assumption that lacks rational basis. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 793, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If a person is wearing a swimsuit he cannot play basketball.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If a person is wearing a swimsuit he cannot play basketball\" may not necessarily be true. While wearing a swimsuit may not be the most conventional or practical attire for playing basketball, it does not physically prevent someone from playing the sport. People can still shoot hoops, dribble, and move around the court while wearing a swimsuit. The choice of clothing does not inherently restrict one's ability to play basketball, although it may not provide the same level of support or coverage as traditional basketball attire. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 794, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If a person is wearing a swimsuit he is going to bed.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If a person is wearing a swimsuit he is going to bed\" does not align with common sense. Typically, swimsuits are worn for activities such as swimming or sunbathing, not for sleeping. Going to bed usually involves wearing sleepwear or pajamas, which are designed for comfort and warmth during sleep. Swimsuits, on the other hand, are designed for water activities and are not typically associated with bedtime routines. Therefore, the statement does not reflect a typical or logical scenario. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 795, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If a person is wearing a swimsuit out to a restaurant.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If a person is wearing a swimsuit out to a restaurant\" may not align with common norms or expectations of appropriate attire for a dining establishment. Typically, restaurants have dress codes that require patrons to be dressed in a manner that is considered presentable and respectful to the environment and other diners. Wearing a swimsuit, which is generally more casual and revealing, might not meet these standards, especially if the restaurant is not located in a beach or poolside area. It is generally expected that individuals will wear more complete and less casual clothing when dining out. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 796, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If a person is wearing a swimsuit that person will attend a college class.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If a person is wearing a swimsuit that person will attend a college class\" does not align with common sense. Typically, swimsuits are worn for swimming or other water-related activities, and are not considered appropriate attire for a college class. College classes generally require students to wear clothing that is more conducive to a learning environment. Therefore, wearing a swimsuit does not logically imply that a person will attend a college class. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 797, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If a person is wearing a swimsuit they are going into outer space.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If a person is wearing a swimsuit they are going into outer space\" does not align with common sense. Typically, swimsuits are designed for use in water-based activities, such as swimming or sunbathing, and are not suitable for the extreme conditions of outer space. Astronauts going into outer space require specialized space suits that provide life support and protection against the vacuum and radiation of space. Therefore, the connection between wearing a swimsuit and going into outer space is illogical and not based on practical reasoning. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 798, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If a person is wearing a swimsuit they will want to go into a freezer.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If a person is wearing a swimsuit they will want to go into a freezer\" is not common sense. Typically, swimsuits are worn in warm environments such as beaches or swimming pools, where the intention is to cool off by swimming or sunbathing. A freezer, on the other hand, is an extremely cold environment that is not suitable for someone wearing minimal clothing like a swimsuit, as it could lead to discomfort or health risks such as hypothermia. Therefore, the desire to enter a freezer while wearing a swimsuit is not a logical or common response. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 799, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If a person is wearing a swimsuit they're going to the movie theater.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If a person is wearing a swimsuit they're going to the movie theater\" does not align with common sense. Typically, swimsuits are worn for activities involving water, such as swimming at a pool or beach. Going to a movie theater, on the other hand, is an indoor activity where casual or more formal attire is usually expected. Wearing a swimsuit to a movie theater would be considered unusual and not appropriate for the setting. Therefore, the statement does not reflect a logical or common scenario. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 800, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If a person is wearing a swimsuit tp go ice skating.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If a person is wearing a swimsuit to go ice skating\" does not align with common sense. Ice skating typically takes place in cold environments, either on a frozen body of water or in an ice rink, where temperatures are kept low to maintain the ice. Wearing a swimsuit, which is designed for warm weather and water activities, would not provide adequate protection or insulation against the cold conditions experienced while ice skating. It is more sensible to wear warm clothing and layers to protect against the cold and prevent hypothermia. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 801, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If a person justifies their actions they would keep mute and be proud.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If a person justifies their actions they would keep mute and be proud\" suggests that someone who has rationalized their actions would choose not to speak about them and would exhibit a sense of pride. However, this may not always be the case as people can justify their actions for various reasons and may choose to either talk about them or remain silent depending on the situation and their personality. Additionally, feeling pride after justifying actions is subjective and can vary widely among individuals. Therefore, the statement does not necessarily align with common sense as it assumes a uniform response to justifying actions, which may not reflect the diversity of human behavior and emotions.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 802, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If a person lands a job they will come into work late the first day.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If a person lands a job they will come into work late the first day\" does not necessarily reflect common sense. Common sense suggests that a person would want to make a good impression on their first day and would therefore aim to be punctual. Coming in late on the first day could give a negative impression to the employer and coworkers. There can be unforeseen circumstances that cause someone to be late, but it is not a general rule that someone will be late on their first day simply because they landed a job. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 803, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If a person starts exercising he would want to make sure that he eat protein first so that his protein does not get low.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement is not entirely based on common sense. While it is true that protein is an important nutrient for muscle repair and growth, consuming protein before exercising is not necessary to prevent protein levels from getting low. The body has protein reserves and can efficiently utilize them as needed during exercise. Additionally, eating a balanced meal containing carbohydrates, proteins, and fats a few hours before exercising can provide sustained energy and support muscle function more effectively than consuming only protein. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 804, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If a person uses the litter box then a person is organized.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If a person uses the litter box then a person is organized\" does not seem to align with common sense. In general, a litter box is intended for use by cats, not humans. The use of a litter box by a person does not inherently indicate that the person is organized. Being organized typically involves maintaining order and structure in one's environment and tasks, which is not directly related to using a litter box. Therefore, the connection between using a litter box and being organized is not logically sound. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 805, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If a person works well they will usually be rewarded for their efforts.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If a person works well they will usually be rewarded for their efforts\" is generally seen as common sense because it aligns with the widely held belief that hard work and good performance are often recognized and appreciated, whether in a professional, academic, or personal context. Many cultures and societies value the principle of meritocracy, where rewards and opportunities are based on one's abilities and achievements. While there are exceptions and external factors that can influence the outcome, the idea that hard work leads to rewards is a common motivational concept. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 806, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If a study finds that 59 percent of texans oppose permitless carry of handguns the state shouldn't allow it.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement in question posits that the majority opinion of a state's population should guide legislative decisions on specific policies, in this case, the permitless carry of handguns. The idea that laws and regulations should reflect the will of the majority of constituents is a fundamental principle of representative democracy. When a significant majority of the population opposes a particular policy, it can be seen as reasonable for legislators to take that into consideration when making laws, as they are elected to represent the interests and safety of their constituents.\n\nHowever, it's also important to consider that majority opinion isn't the sole factor that should influence policy decisions. Other factors, such as constitutional rights, minority protections, and expert opinions, should also be considered to ensure that laws are just, equitable, and in line with the broader values and principles of the society.\n\nIn this specific case, if 59 percent of Texans oppose permitless carry of handguns, it suggests a significant portion of the population has concerns about the safety and implications of such a policy. If the opposition is based on evidence and reasoned arguments that suggest permitless carry could lead to increased violence or accidents, it would be sensible for the state to consider these concerns seriously in their decision-making process.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 807, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If a woman wears the briefest of clothing dances provocatively walks down dark streets alone or drinks more than she knows she should it makes her vulnerable.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement perpetuates the harmful and incorrect notion that a woman's behavior or clothing choices are to blame for making her vulnerable to harm. It shifts the responsibility from the perpetrator to the victim and reinforces victim-blaming attitudes. The focus should be on promoting a culture of respect and consent, and on addressing and preventing harmful behaviors, rather than on policing women's choices. Women have the right to make their own choices about their clothing and behavior without being held responsible for the actions of others.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 808, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If a word is worth one shekel silence is worth two.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that silence can be more valuable than speaking. In many situations, choosing to remain silent can prevent misunderstandings, conflicts, or can give space for reflection and thoughtful responses. Silence can also convey respect, attentiveness, and contemplation, which may be more impactful than words in certain contexts. Therefore, the idea that silence can hold greater value than speaking aligns with common sense in various social and interpersonal situations. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 809, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex accidentally stepped in dog poop they would immediately clean their shoe.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex accidentally stepped in dog poop they would immediately clean their shoe\" is based on the general understanding that people prefer to maintain cleanliness and remove unpleasant substances from their belongings, especially when it comes to something as unhygienic and foul-smelling as dog poop. Cleaning the shoe would help eliminate the odor and prevent the spread of bacteria. Most people would find it uncomfortable and socially inappropriate to walk around with dog poop on their shoes. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that the immediate cleaning of the shoe is a common response in such a situation. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 810, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex affects sam's health he would make joke off it.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that if Alex negatively impacts Sam's health, he would trivialize it by making a joke. This behavior is not common or acceptable as it shows a lack of empathy and responsibility for the consequences of one's actions. Making light of someone's health issues can be harmful and is generally not considered appropriate. Therefore, the statement does not represent common sense behavior.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 811, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex affects sam's health he would take care of it when need be.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex affects Sam's health he would take care of it when need be\" implies that Alex would take responsibility for any negative impact he may have on Sam's health and address it appropriately. This reflects a sense of accountability and concern for the well-being of others, which is generally considered a common-sense approach to interpersonal relationships. It demonstrates an understanding that one should rectify any harm they cause, especially when it comes to someone's health. Therefore, the statement aligns with common-sense values of responsibility and empathy.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 812, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex affects sam's health they stop doing whatever it is that harms sam and apologizes.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that if Alex harms Sam's health, they should stop the harmful behavior and apologize. This aligns with general principles of accountability and responsibility for one's actions, especially when those actions negatively impact others. It is a common expectation in relationships and social interactions to address and rectify any harm caused. Therefore, the statement reflects a basic ethical consideration towards the well-being of others.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 813, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex arrives at alex's destination then the person would be happy that they have reached their destination.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that a person named Alex would feel happy upon reaching their destination, which is a common emotional response when achieving a goal or completing a journey. It is reasonable to assume that reaching a desired destination brings a sense of accomplishment, relief, or satisfaction, which typically elicits happiness. Therefore, the statement aligns with general human experiences and emotions associated with completing a travel objective.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 814, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex arrives at alex's destination then the person would realize they have arrived at a wrong location.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that regardless of Alex arriving at his intended destination, he would realize it is the wrong location. This scenario implies either a misunderstanding of the destination or a change of plans unknown to Alex. However, this is not a common sense conclusion as typically arriving at one's destination would confirm that it is the correct location based on prior knowledge or intent. Without additional context suggesting why the destination would be wrong despite being the intended one, it is not reasonable to assume the statement as common sense.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 815, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex arrives at alex's destination they will have forgotten something important.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex arrives at Alex's destination they will have forgotten something important\" is not necessarily common sense because it assumes that forgetting something important is an inevitable outcome for Alex upon arriving at a destination. This assumption may not hold true for everyone, as it largely depends on individual characteristics such as memory, organization skills, and preparedness. Forgetting something important is not a guaranteed outcome for everyone in similar situations.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 816, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex arrives at alex's destination they will have made it with everything they need.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex arrives at Alex's destination they will have made it with everything they need\" implies that arriving at the destination equates to having everything necessary for the purpose of the visit. This suggests careful planning and preparation were involved to ensure all essentials were accounted for before reaching the destination. In many practical scenarios, such as traveling for business or vacation, ensuring you have everything you need upon arrival is indeed common sense as it allows for a smoother, more successful trip. Therefore, the statement aligns with practical and logical thinking.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 817, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex arrives at alex's destination they would run their car into the building.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex arrives at Alex's destination they would run their car into the building\" does not seem to be common sense. Common sense would suggest that when someone arrives at their destination, they would park their car safely and appropriately, rather than deliberately causing damage or risking harm by running their car into a building. This behavior would be unusual and irrational under normal circumstances.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 818, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex arrives at alex's destination they would safely shut off the car.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex arrives at Alex's destination they would safely shut off the car\" suggests that once Alex has reached their destination, it is a sensible and responsible action to turn off the car to prevent any potential accidents and conserve fuel. This is a common practice and is considered a basic safety measure when operating a vehicle. Therefore, it aligns with common sense to shut off the car once the destination is reached to ensure safety and efficiency.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 819, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex asks a question he would listen attentively to the response.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex asks a question he would listen attentively to the response\" suggests that Alex is genuinely interested in the answer, which is why he asked the question in the first place. It is common sense that someone who asks a question would want to hear and understand the response, as it would provide them with the information or clarification they are seeking. Therefore, it is reasonable to expect that Alex would listen attentively.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 820, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex asks a question he wouldn't mind the response.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex asks a question he wouldn't mind the response\" suggests that Alex is open to receiving any type of answer when he poses a question, indicating a level of open-mindedness and preparedness for various responses. This can be seen as common sense because it is generally expected that when someone asks a question, they are ready and willing to receive an answer, whatever it may be. Additionally, asking questions typically implies a desire to gain information or clarity, so being receptive to the response aligns with the purpose of inquiry. Therefore, it is reasonable to consider this statement as aligning with common sense.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 821, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex asks for sam explanation he will weigh it against his own judgment.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement reflects a common decision-making process where an individual seeks advice or information from another person and then evaluates that information based on their own judgment and perspective. It is a typical and rational approach to making informed decisions, as it involves gathering input and critically assessing it before coming to a conclusion. Therefore, this statement aligns with a logical and reasonable way of thinking.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 822, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex avoids like the plague they will expect to catch an illness.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex avoids like the plague they will expect to catch an illness\" is not necessarily common sense. The phrase \"avoid like the plague\" is a metaphorical expression meaning to stay away from something or someone to a great extent, but it does not literally imply expecting to catch an illness. The expectation of catching an illness would depend on the context or reason why Alex is avoiding something, which is not specified in the statement. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 823, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex avoids like the plague they would make sure they would not see who they were avoiding.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that if Alex is actively avoiding someone or something \"like the plague,\" they would take measures to ensure they do not encounter the person or thing they are avoiding. This implies a deliberate effort to steer clear and minimize any possibility of contact. Common sense dictates that if someone is intentionally avoiding something, they would indeed make efforts to keep their distance and avoid any interactions. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 824, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex bats a thousand than they did not swing and miss any ball whatsoever.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex bats a thousand then they did not swing and miss any ball whatsoever\" implies that Alex had a perfect batting average, which means they successfully hit every ball pitched to them without missing. In baseball, a batting average of 1.000 (or \"batting a thousand\") is achieved when a player gets a hit every time they are at bat, which inherently means they did not swing and miss at any pitches. Therefore, the statement aligns with the understanding of batting averages and the performance it describes. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 825, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex becomes a police officer they would go back to school for a finance degree.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex becomes a police officer they would go back to school for a finance degree\" does not logically align with common sense because becoming a police officer and pursuing a finance degree are generally unrelated career paths. Typically, becoming a police officer involves attending a police academy and receiving specialized training in law enforcement, while obtaining a finance degree involves studying economics, accounting, and financial management, which are not directly applicable to police work. Therefore, it is uncommon for someone to pursue a finance degree specifically as a result of becoming a police officer.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 826, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex becomes a police officer they would learn how to fire their gun better.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex becomes a police officer they would learn how to fire their gun better\" implies that police training includes firearms training, which is generally true. Police officers are required to undergo extensive training in various areas including the use of firearms to ensure they can handle situations safely and effectively. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that if Alex becomes a police officer, they would receive training that would improve their skills in handling and firing a gun.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 827, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex bothers sam so much alex will feel ashamed.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that if Alex bothers Sam excessively, Alex will feel ashamed as a result of his actions. This implies that Alex has a sense of empathy or a moral compass that makes him feel guilty for causing distress to Sam. Whether this statement is common sense or not depends on the assumption that Alex has the capacity for empathy and the ability to recognize the impact of his actions on others. However, common sense cannot definitively predict individual feelings, as people's responses to their actions can vary widely based on their personal values, upbringing, and psychological factors. Therefore, the statement is not universally applicable as common sense, since it relies on specific assumptions about Alex's character. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 828, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex breaks sam's ankle alex may take home a piece of sam's ankle and put it on their mantle.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement does not reflect common sense as it suggests causing intentional harm and taking a body part as a trophy, which is not a typical or morally acceptable behavior. Additionally, it is illegal and unethical to intentionally harm someone and keep a body part as a souvenir. Therefore, the statement does not align with common sense or societal norms.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 829, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex breaks sam's ankle alex would then begin to repeatedly stomp on sam's ankle hoping that this would set the broken bones back into place.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement is not common sense because repeatedly stomping on a broken ankle would not help set the bones back into place, but instead would likely cause further injury and damage. Proper medical attention is required to treat a broken ankle, and stomping on it would only worsen the situation. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 830, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex breaks sam's ankle sam deserved it.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex breaks Sam's ankle, Sam deserved it\" is not necessarily common sense. Common sense generally suggests that violence or harm should not be a justifiable response to a situation unless it is in self-defense or to protect others. The statement implies that Sam deserved to have their ankle broken by Alex, which suggests a form of retribution or punishment without context or justification. This does not align with common principles of justice and fairness, where actions should be proportional and justified. Therefore, this statement does not reflect common sense as it promotes the idea of inflicting harm without clear reasoning.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 831, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex breaks sam's ankle they will simply continue on their way.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "No, the statement does not represent common sense. Breaking someone's ankle is a serious injury that would likely cause significant pain and impede mobility, making it difficult or impossible for the injured person to continue on their way without seeking medical attention. Additionally, it suggests a disregard for the well-being of others, which is not aligned with common sense or ethical behavior. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 832, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex breaks sam's ankle what is the matter.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement is not common sense because it assumes that breaking someone's ankle is a trivial issue and implies that there might be a valid reason for such an action. In reality, causing physical harm to another person is a serious matter and is generally considered unacceptable behavior. Additionally, the statement is phrased as a question, which suggests ambiguity or uncertainty about whether breaking someone's ankle is problematic, further highlighting its lack of common sense.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 833, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex breaks sam's foot sam will wish that alex did not break their foot.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex breaks Sam's foot, Sam will wish that Alex did not break their foot\" suggests that Sam would experience pain or inconvenience as a result of the injury, and therefore would prefer that the injury had not occurred. This is a reasonable assumption, as people generally prefer to avoid pain and injury. Therefore, the statement aligns with common sense, as it reflects a typical human reaction to being hurt.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 834, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex breaks sam's foot than sam will ask why alex did that.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement reflects a common reaction one might have if they were injured by someone else, as it is natural to seek an explanation or reason for the harm caused. In this case, Sam's response to ask why Alex broke his foot follows a logical and understandable pattern of seeking understanding in the face of a negative action. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 835, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex breaks sam's foot won't even think to offer to help pay for the medical bills that arose due to the injury alex caused.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement implies that Alex, the person responsible for causing the injury, would not consider helping with the resulting medical expenses. Generally, it is expected that someone who causes harm to another person should at least offer to help with any consequences arising from their actions. It is a common ethical and moral expectation to take responsibility for one's actions, especially if they have caused harm to someone else. Therefore, it would be considered uncommon or contrary to general expectations for Alex not to offer assistance with the medical bills. \n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 836, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex brings down the house alex will feel guilty.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex brings down the house Alex will feel guilty\" suggests that if Alex causes significant damage or destruction to a house, he will experience guilt as a result. The idea that someone would feel guilty after causing substantial harm or loss aligns with a common understanding of human emotions and moral responsibility. It is generally expected that individuals feel remorseful after their actions lead to negative consequences, especially when it involves damaging property or causing distress to others. Therefore, the statement reflects a typical expectation of emotional response in such a situation.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 837, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex brings down the house he she is careful to remain greatful and humble.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that if someone, in this case Alex, achieves great success or recognition (figuratively \"bringing down the house\"), they should remain grateful and humble. This is a common sentiment as humility and gratitude are often seen as positive traits, especially in the face of success. They help maintain good relationships and a positive reputation. It is generally considered wise and sensible to not let success lead to arrogance.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 838, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex brings sam a spare key he or she will make use of one out of it.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that if Alex provides Sam with a spare key, Sam will find a use for it. This is a logical assumption, as spare keys are typically given to grant access to a locked space or provide a backup in case the primary key is lost. The utility of having a spare key is clear in scenarios where access might be needed, and having a spare key can offer convenience and security.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 839, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex brings sam a spare key they will first think of which one to use.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex brings Sam a spare key they will first think of which one to use\" is not necessarily common sense. The need to think about which key to use would depend on whether the keys look different or are otherwise distinguishable. If the spare key is clearly identifiable or if there is only one spare key brought, there would be no need to think about which one to use. Therefore, the statement assumes a scenario that may not always apply. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 840, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex brings sam a spare key they will leave it in their mailbox without telling them about it.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "Leaving a spare key in the mailbox without informing the recipient lacks common sense for several reasons. Firstly, it poses a security risk as anyone could potentially access the key if they know it's in the mailbox. Secondly, without informing the recipient, they may not be aware that the key is there, leading to confusion or the key being overlooked. Effective communication is key in such situations to ensure that the key is safely and successfully transferred. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 841, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex brings sam the news it is more than likely true.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that Alex is a reliable source of information when bringing news to Sam. Whether or not this statement is common sense depends on Alex's track record for truthfulness and accuracy. If Alex has consistently proven to be trustworthy and accurate with information, then it would be common sense to believe that the news they bring is likely true. However, without any context about Alex's reliability, it is difficult to determine if the statement is common sense universally. Common sense typically relies on general knowledge or widely accepted beliefs, and without further information about Alex, this statement cannot be assumed to be common sense for everyone. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 842, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex brings sam the news sam should not believe them.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex brings Sam the news, Sam should not believe them\" suggests a lack of trustworthiness in Alex's ability to relay accurate information. However, without knowing the context or the relationship between Alex and Sam, or Alex's history with providing reliable information, it is not possible to determine if Sam should categorically dismiss news from Alex. Common sense would dictate evaluating the credibility of the news based on the content, the source, and possibly corroborating with other sources, rather than dismissing it solely based on the messenger. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 843, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex brings sam to the ground alex will not stop and create a seriously bad situation.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that if Alex physically brings Sam to the ground, Alex may continue to behave aggressively, potentially escalating the situation further. This assertion relies on assumptions about Alex's behavior and temperament, which may not be universally true or predictable. It's important to consider individual circumstances and context before making a generalized statement about someone's actions. Without specific information about Alex's past behavior or the situation at hand, it's difficult to determine the accuracy of the statement as a common-sense conclusion.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 844, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex brings sam to the ground alex will refrain and make things right.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex brings Sam to the ground Alex will refrain and make things right\" suggests that Alex would take responsibility for his actions and try to rectify the situation if he were to physically bring Sam down. Whether this is common sense depends on the context and the characters involved. If Alex is generally known to be a responsible and conscientious person, it would be common sense to expect him to make amends after such an incident. However, without further information about Alex's personality and the specific circumstances, it is difficult to definitively say this is common sense.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 845, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex brings sam to the ground because they are practicing tactical maneuvers.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex brings Sam to the ground because they are practicing tactical maneuvers\" suggests that the action of bringing Sam to the ground is intentional and part of a training exercise. In the context of practicing tactical maneuvers, such actions are common as they simulate real-life scenarios where one may need to neutralize an opponent or control a situation. Therefore, the statement aligns with the common sense understanding of what happens during tactical training exercises. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 846, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex brushes sam's teeth they will ask permission first.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement, \"If Alex brushes Sam's teeth they will ask permission first,\" aligns with the common sense notion of respecting personal boundaries and obtaining consent before engaging in actions that involve another person's body. Brushing someone's teeth is an intimate activity, and it is generally expected that one would seek permission before performing such an act on someone else. Therefore, the idea of asking for permission under these circumstances is both considerate and appropriate.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 847, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex brushes sam's teeth they will use a hair brush.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex brushes Sam's teeth they will use a hair brush\" does not align with common sense. Typically, teeth are brushed using a toothbrush, which is specifically designed for cleaning teeth, not a hair brush which is meant for grooming hair. Using a hair brush to clean teeth would be ineffective and could potentially cause harm to the gums or teeth. Therefore, the statement contradicts conventional practices of dental hygiene.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 848, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex brushes sam's teeth they will use a tooth brush.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex brushes Sam's teeth they will use a toothbrush\" is based on the typical method of brushing teeth, which involves using a toothbrush. It is common practice and the most effective way to clean teeth, and it is generally understood that brushing teeth is done with a toothbrush. Therefore, the statement aligns with common sense as it reflects the conventional and widely accepted approach to oral hygiene.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 849, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex brushes sam's teeth they will use peanut butter.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex brushes Sam's teeth they will use peanut butter\" is not common sense because peanut butter is not a typical or effective tooth-cleaning substance. Toothpaste is specifically formulated for cleaning teeth and promoting oral health, while peanut butter could potentially cause harm to the teeth and gums due to its sticky consistency and high sugar content. Using peanut butter as a tooth-cleaning agent is unconventional and not recommended by dental professionals. \n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 850, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex builds a birdhouse they will hang it outside.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex builds a birdhouse they will hang it outside\" is based on the typical use and purpose of a birdhouse, which is to provide shelter for birds outdoors. Birdhouses are generally designed to be hung outside so that birds can access them easily. It is a common practice to hang birdhouses outdoors to attract birds and provide them with a safe nesting space. Therefore, it is logical and reasonable to conclude that if Alex builds a birdhouse, they will hang it outside to serve its intended function.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 851, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex builds a birdhouse they would hang it inside the house.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex builds a birdhouse they would hang it inside the house\" does not align with common sense. Typically, birdhouses are designed to be hung outside to provide shelter for birds and to attract them to the garden or yard. Hanging a birdhouse inside would defeat its purpose as birds would not be able to access it. Additionally, birdhouses are meant to withstand outdoor weather conditions and may not complement indoor aesthetics. \n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 852, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex buys a new chair he will give it to his dog.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex buys a new chair he will give it to his dog\" does not seem to align with common sense, as typically chairs are made for human use rather than for pets. It is more common for pet owners to purchase specialized pet furniture or beds that are specifically designed for animal comfort and safety. Additionally, the durability and materials of regular chairs may not be suitable or safe for pets. Therefore, it is unlikely that buying a chair for the primary purpose of giving it to a dog would be a practical or reasonable decision. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 853, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex buys a new chair he would never even think to sit in the chair.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex buys a new chair he would never even think to sit in the chair\" is not common sense. Typically, when someone purchases a chair, the purpose is to sit on it and make use of it. The statement contradicts the typical purpose and utility of a chair. Unless there's a specific reason for not using the chair, such as it being a decorative or collectible item, it's reasonable to expect that someone would sit in a chair they've purchased.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 854, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex buys a new chair they will give it away immediatly.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex buys a new chair they will give it away immediately\" does not seem to align with common sense. Generally, when someone buys a new item, especially furniture like a chair, they purchase it for personal use or to fulfill a specific need in their home or office. Giving it away immediately would negate the purpose of buying it in the first place. Additionally, there is no logical reason provided in the statement to explain why Alex would give away a newly purchased chair immediately.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 855, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex buys milk what do we do with this.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex buys milk what do we do with this\" is not necessarily common sense, as it lacks context and specificity. It is not clear what \"this\" refers to, and without additional information, it is difficult to determine an appropriate response or action. Common sense typically involves practical judgment and clear understanding, which this statement does not provide. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 856, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex calls a locksmith he will expect his situation to be fixed for free.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex calls a locksmith he will expect his situation to be fixed for free\" does not align with common sense. Typically, locksmith services are professional services that require payment. It is generally understood that specialized services, such as those provided by a locksmith, come at a cost. Therefore, it would not be reasonable or common sense for Alex to expect the service to be provided for free without any prior arrangement or special circumstances indicating that.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 857, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex calls a locksmith they will close the door.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex calls a locksmith they will close the door\" does not necessarily align with common sense, as the primary job of a locksmith is to help with locks and keys, such as unlocking locked doors, making new keys, or installing new locks. While a locksmith may close a door as part of their service, it is not an inherent or guaranteed action when calling a locksmith. The main focus of calling a locksmith is related to issues with locks and keys, not specifically to close a door. Therefore, the statement does not directly correlate with the typical duties of a locksmith. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 858, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex calls a locksmith they will open the door.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex calls a locksmith they will open the door\" is based on the common understanding that locksmiths are professionals trained to unlock doors when individuals are locked out or have lost their keys. It is reasonable to assume that if Alex contacts a locksmith, the locksmith will be able to open the door using their skills and tools. Therefore, the statement aligns with general expectations of a locksmith's services. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 859, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex calls sam's mother they would hang up immediately after she answered.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex calls Sam's mother they would hang up immediately after she answered\" suggests there may be a specific context or backstory not provided in the sentence itself, such as a strained relationship or previous conflict between Alex and Sam's mother. Without additional information on the nature of their relationship or past interactions, it's difficult to determine if this statement is common sense. Common sense would typically involve a general, widely understood principle or judgment, and this statement seems too specific and context-dependent to meet that criteria.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 860, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex calls sam's mother they would have a conversation about sam.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex calls Sam's mother, they would have a conversation about Sam\" relies on the assumption that Alex and Sam's mother share a common interest in Sam, which is plausible if Alex is calling specifically to discuss something related to Sam. This could be a typical scenario if Alex is a friend, relative, or someone involved in Sam's life. It is common for conversations to revolve around mutual connections or reasons for the call. However, it's not guaranteed as the conversation could potentially divert to other topics or if Alex has a different primary reason for the call. Despite this possibility, based on the general context provided, it is reasonable to think that Sam would be a likely topic of discussion. \n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 861, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex calls sam's mother they would immediately hang up on them.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex calls Sam's mother they would immediately hang up on them\" is not necessarily common sense because it lacks context. Common sense would require understanding the relationship between Alex and Sam's mother, whether there's a history of conflict, or any reason for Sam's mother to hang up immediately. Without this information, it's impossible to determine if the statement reflects a common-sense outcome. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 862, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex calls to account a memory than it would be made up.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex calls to account a memory then it would be made up\" suggests that any memory recounted by Alex is fabricated or not based on actual events. This assumes that Alex is incapable of recalling real events accurately, which may not be a fair or accurate assumption. Memory recall can be influenced by various factors, but it does not necessarily mean that all memories recounted by an individual are fictional. Therefore, the statement may not align with common sense as it generalizes Alex's ability to recall memories without considering the complexity of human memory and potential for accurate recall.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 863, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex calls to account alex is dead.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex calls to account Alex is dead\" does not appear to follow common sense as it presents a logical inconsistency. The phrase \"calls to account\" typically refers to holding someone responsible or demanding an explanation. It is unclear how this action would directly lead to someone being dead. Additionally, the statement seems to lack context or further explanation that would clarify the connection between the two clauses. Therefore, it is difficult to interpret this statement as making logical or common sense.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 864, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex calls upon to perform they will run away and hide.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex calls upon to perform they will run away and hide\" may not be considered common sense as it is based on an assumption about an individual's behavior without any context or evidence. Common sense typically involves practical and sound judgment based on simple perception of the situation or facts. The statement doesn't provide enough information to make a reasoned judgment about the behavior of the individual named Alex when asked to perform. Therefore, it cannot be universally accepted as common sense.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 865, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex catches a bird and decides to keep it as a pet despite not knowing anything about it.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "Keeping a wild animal as a pet without knowledge about its care and needs can lead to harm for both the animal and the owner. Wild animals have specific dietary, environmental, and behavioral needs that differ from domestic pets, and not meeting these needs can lead to health issues or aggressive behavior. Additionally, there may be legal restrictions on keeping certain wild animals as pets. Therefore, deciding to keep a bird as a pet without any prior knowledge is not a decision that aligns with common sense. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 866, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex catches a bird and lets it go after observing it knowing that keeping it is a bad idea.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement implies that Alex recognizes that keeping a bird captive is not a good idea, which suggests an understanding of the potential negative impact on the bird's well-being and freedom. It also reflects a responsible and ethical decision to observe the bird and then release it back into its natural habitat, rather than causing it harm by keeping it confined. This aligns with common principles of animal welfare and conservation, which are widely accepted and promoted in society. Therefore, the decision to let the bird go after realizing that keeping it is detrimental is a reflection of common sense in terms of ethical treatment of wildlife. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 867, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex catches a bird he cut its wings.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex catches a bird he cut its wings\" does not seem to reflect common sense. Common sense suggests treating animals with care and kindness, and cutting a bird's wings after catching it would be considered inhumane and cruel. Additionally, common sense would dictate that such an action is unnecessary and harmful to the bird's well-being and ability to thrive in its natural environment. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 868, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex catches a bird he pet that bird.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex catches a bird he pet that bird\" implies that Alex interacts with the bird in a caring and gentle manner after catching it. However, it's not necessarily common sense to assume this behavior. Catching a bird could be for various reasons, such as for research, rehabilitation, or even for hunting purposes. Petting the bird may not always be appropriate or safe for either Alex or the bird, depending on the circumstances and the bird's condition. Additionally, not everyone may have the same reaction or behavior towards animals. Therefore, it is not common sense to assume that catching a bird always leads to petting it.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 869, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex catches sam eye have treatment for stabismus.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex catches Sam's eye, have treatment for strabismus\" is not common sense. Strabismus is a medical condition related to the alignment of the eyes, and it typically requires diagnosis and treatment by a medical professional. Catching someone's eye in a figurative sense, meaning to attract their attention or notice, does not cause or indicate strabismus. The statement seems to confuse a metaphorical expression with a medical condition, which does not align with common sense or medical knowledge.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 870, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex celebrates sam's victory they say we did this.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests a sense of shared accomplishment or collective effort, implying that Alex feels a personal connection to Sam's victory, possibly because they contributed to it or have a close relationship with Sam. This kind of sentiment is common when people work together towards a common goal or support each other in their individual endeavors. Expressing a collective achievement by saying \"we did this\" is a way to acknowledge the support and effort of everyone involved, not just the individual who directly achieved the victory.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 871, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex celebrates sam's victory they will prepare a funeral.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex celebrates Sam's victory they will prepare a funeral\" is not common sense because it suggests an illogical and extreme consequence for a positive event. Celebrating a victory is usually associated with joy and happiness, not preparing for a funeral, which is a somber and serious occasion associated with death. The statement lacks a logical connection between the cause (celebrating a victory) and the effect (preparing a funeral), making it nonsensical in terms of common understanding. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 872, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex celebrates sam's victory they would jump up and down.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that if Alex is happy about Sam's victory, they would express their excitement by jumping up and down. This behavior is a common way for people to show joy and enthusiasm, especially in celebratory contexts. It aligns with typical human expressions of happiness in response to positive events. Therefore, the statement reflects a natural and understandable reaction. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 873, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex changes sam's way he will help sam find his way out of the maze.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that if Alex influences or alters Sam's approach or method, then Alex will assist Sam in navigating out of a maze. This implies a cause-and-effect relationship where changing Sam\u2019s way is a condition for Alex to help. In everyday situations, helping someone usually comes from a place of cooperation and support, not conditional on changing their approach first. Therefore, the statement does not align with common sense as it sets an unnecessary precondition for offering help. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 874, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex changes sam's way sam would become smarter.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex changes Sam's way, Sam would become smarter\" implies that altering Sam's behavior or approach could lead to increased intelligence. However, intelligence is a complex trait influenced by various factors including genetics, environment, and personal experiences. Simply changing someone's way or method may not necessarily make them smarter, as it could depend on the effectiveness of the new approach and how well it aligns with Sam's individual learning style and capabilities.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 875, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex changes the baby's diaper it will fit snugly but not too tight and stay on securely with pins.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that Alex has the skill to properly change a baby's diaper so that it fits well and stays secure. This implies a level of competence and familiarity with the task. However, without knowing more about Alex's experience with changing diapers, it's difficult to definitively say whether this statement is common sense. It largely depends on Alex's prior knowledge and experience with diaper changing. \n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 876, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex changes the baby's diaper pigeon not ultra premium baby diaper pants.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement appears to be incomplete and lacks coherence, making it difficult to assess its common sense. The first part of the sentence, \"If Alex changes the baby's diaper,\" sets up a conditional scenario, but the latter part, \"pigeon not ultra premium baby diaper pants,\" seems unrelated and unclear. This creates confusion about the relationship between the two parts of the statement and what is actually being conveyed.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 877, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex changes the baby's diaper pigeon ultra premium baby diaper pants.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex changes the baby's diaper pigeon ultra premium baby diaper pants\" is not a complete or coherent sentence, and it lacks a clear cause-and-effect relationship or logical condition and consequence. It seems to be a fragment or incorrectly structured, making it difficult to determine if it represents common sense. A sensible version might be, \"If Alex changes the baby's diaper, he should use Pigeon Ultra Premium Baby Diaper Pants.\" But as it stands, the statement itself does not convey a clear or sensible idea. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 878, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex comes and get sam then morgan would assume that they are invited to go with both alex and sam as well.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement is not necessarily common sense, as it relies on assumptions about the relationship dynamics and communication between Alex, Sam, and Morgan. Without explicit communication or prior understanding, Morgan may not automatically assume they are invited to join Alex and Sam. Assumptions about social situations can vary greatly depending on individual perspectives and experiences. Therefore, it is not common sense to assume that Morgan would automatically think they are invited.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 879, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex comes near sam i am scared.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex comes near Sam I am scared\" suggests that there is a specific reason or context that causes fear when Alex approaches Sam. This could be due to past experiences, known threats, or other factors that are not explicitly mentioned in the statement. Without further information about the relationship between Alex and Sam or the reasons behind the fear, it is difficult to determine if the statement is common sense. Common sense typically involves judgments or perceptions that are widely understood and accepted based on shared experiences or knowledge. Since the statement lacks context and does not provide a universally relatable scenario, it is not necessarily common sense. \n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 880, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex comes near sam sam will just not care.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex comes near Sam, Sam will just not care\" implies that Sam is indifferent to Alex's presence. This could be common sense if it is known that Sam has no particular feelings, positive or negative, towards Alex. However, without further context about their relationship or Sam's personality, it is difficult to definitively say whether this reaction is common sense. Personal relationships and individual reactions can vary widely.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 881, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex comes near sam they are trying to threaten them into handing over money.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex comes near Sam they are trying to threaten them into handing over money\" is not necessarily common sense. Common sense would require more context or evidence to support the claim that Alex's presence near Sam indicates a threat for money. Without additional information, it is an assumption and could be an incorrect interpretation of the situation. Therefore, it is not a statement that can be universally accepted as common sense based solely on the information given.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 882, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex comes near sam they will make awful noises.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement is not common sense as it lacks context and clarity. It does not specify why Alex and Sam would make awful noises when near each other or under what circumstances this would happen. It could be interpreted in many ways, such as a joke or a metaphor, but without further information, it is not a reasonable assumption. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 883, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex comes near sam they would bump them on purpose.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that Alex has the intention to bump into Sam on purpose if they come near each other. This indicates a specific behavior or intention that is not necessarily common to all individuals. Common sense typically refers to general knowledge or beliefs that most people would agree upon or consider reasonable without needing special knowledge or information. The statement about Alex's behavior is more about a particular individual's actions rather than a broadly accepted principle or understanding.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 884, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex conducts research and documents every bit of information they learn.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that Alex is being thorough and diligent in their research process by documenting every bit of information they learn. This is a common practice in research to maintain accurate records and track progress, which helps in analyzing data and drawing conclusions effectively. It also ensures that the research can be reproduced and validated by others in the future.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 885, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex considers sam example most memorable moment in our life.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex considers Sam an example of the most memorable moment in our life\" is not necessarily common sense, as it is subjective and depends on the personal experiences and feelings of the individual, Alex, in this case. Common sense generally refers to practical judgment or shared understanding that is widely accepted by a group. Since memorable moments are unique to each person, what one person finds memorable may not be the same for someone else. Therefore, this statement cannot be considered common sense as it is specific to the individual's perspective and experience. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 886, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex considers sam example then the first person might ask a question regarding the example.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex considers Sam an example then the first person might ask a question regarding the example\" suggests a causal relationship wherein Alex's consideration of Sam as an example prompts the first person to potentially ask a question about it. This assumes that the context in which Alex considers Sam an example is clear and that the first person is interested or invested in understanding or learning more about why Sam is considered an example by Alex. However, the statement is not necessarily common sense as it relies on specific circumstances and the interest or engagement of the first person. Without additional context about the relevance of Sam being an example and the environment in which this interaction occurs, it's not guaranteed or universally understood that the first person would indeed ask a question. Therefore, the statement cannot be considered common sense as it does not universally hold true in all situations.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 887, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex creams in alex's jeans they may walk around all day with cream stains on their crotch.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement describes a logical cause and effect scenario where if someone spills or gets cream on their jeans in the crotch area, it would result in visible stains if not cleaned. It's a straightforward observation based on common knowledge about how stains work. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 888, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex creams in alex's jeans they will enjoy it and then change their pants.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex creams in Alex's jeans they will enjoy it and then change their pants\" is not common sense as it involves assumptions about someone's enjoyment and response to a specific situation that may not apply universally or be considered reasonable or logical in all contexts. The statement also uses informal language and lacks clarity about what it specifically refers to, making it difficult to analyze based on common sense alone.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 889, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex creams in alex's jeans they will go to the bathroom and sop it up the best they can.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement provided is not necessarily common sense as it makes assumptions about behavior and actions that may not apply universally to everyone named Alex or to every possible situation involving creaming in one's jeans. The response to such an event can vary widely depending on the individual's personal preferences, cultural norms, and available resources. It is also important to consider that \"creaming\" in this context is ambiguous and could be interpreted in different ways, which adds to the uncertainty of whether the statement reflects common sense. \n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 890, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex creams in alex's jeans they will take a picture and send it to their friends.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement appears to be inappropriate and not aligned with common social norms or behaviors. Generally, sharing explicit or private content, especially without consent, is not acceptable and can have legal consequences. It's important to respect privacy and boundaries in personal interactions. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 891, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex creams in alex's jeans they would wash their jeans.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that if Alex soils their jeans, they would wash them to clean them. This is a reasonable and hygienic response to getting one's clothing dirty. Washing clothes after they become soiled is a common practice to maintain cleanliness and personal hygiene. \n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 892, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex cries sam a river something bad must have happened.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that if Alex cries \"a river\" or cries excessively, it is an indication that something significant and negative has occurred. This is a common understanding as crying is a natural emotional response to distress, sadness, or pain. Therefore, the connection between excessive crying and a negative event is a reasonable assumption based on common human behavior and emotional responses.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 893, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex cries sam a river they'll make a creek of themself.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex cries Sam a river, they'll make a creek of themself\" appears to be a metaphorical or idiomatic expression, suggesting that if one person expresses a significant emotional outpouring (crying a river), the other person might respond in a smaller but similar manner (making a creek). It is not a literal statement and may not be immediately understood as common sense without context or understanding of the intended metaphor. It is not a widely recognized or standard expression in the English language.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 894, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex cuts sam's arm he will not call for help.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex cuts Sam's arm he will not call for help\" does not seem to align with common sense. In a typical situation, if someone is harmed or injured, their natural response would be to seek help or call for assistance, especially if the injury is significant like a cut on the arm. The statement seems to suggest that Sam would not react in this expected way, which goes against common reasoning without additional context explaining why Sam would not call for help.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 895, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex cuts sam's arm he will try to stop the bleeding.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex cuts Sam's arm he will try to stop the bleeding\" is based on the natural human instinct to prevent further harm and address injuries. In a situation where someone's arm is cut, it is a common response to try to stop the bleeding to prevent blood loss and further complications. This action aligns with basic first aid principles that are widely understood and practiced. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 896, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex cuts sam's arm they will clean the wound with alcohol and then put a bandage on it.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement reflects a common sense approach to basic first aid in the event of a minor cut or injury. Cleaning a wound with alcohol helps to disinfect the area and prevent infection, while applying a bandage protects the wound and aids in the healing process. These actions are standard and recommended procedures in first aid for minor injuries. Therefore, the statement is based on practical and widely accepted health practices. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 897, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex cuts sam's arm they will put put a bandage on it without disinfecting the wound first.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement does not reflect common sense medical practice. It is important to clean and disinfect a wound before applying a bandage to prevent infection and promote proper healing. Applying a bandage without disinfecting the wound can trap bacteria and debris inside, increasing the risk of infection. Therefore, it is advisable to clean the wound with an antiseptic solution or soap and water before applying a bandage. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 898, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex decides to not be friends with sam.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex decides to not be friends with Sam\" is not necessarily a matter of common sense, as it depends on the specific circumstances and reasons behind Alex's decision. Common sense would suggest maintaining friendships when possible, but if there are valid reasons for Alex to end the friendship, such as conflicting values or harmful behavior from Sam, the decision could be justified. Without additional context, it is difficult to determine if the decision aligns with common sense.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 899, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex decides to not be friends with sam sam would feel unliked.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex decides to not be friends with Sam, Sam would feel unliked\" assumes that Sam's feelings are directly tied to Alex's actions and that Sam would interpret the loss of friendship as a reflection of their own likability. This is a possible reaction, as people often feel hurt or rejected when someone they care about chooses to end a relationship. However, it is not necessarily a universal reaction, as individuals have different emotional responses and coping mechanisms. Additionally, the statement doesn't consider other factors that might influence Sam's feelings, such as their self-esteem, support from other friends, or understanding of the reasons behind Alex's decision. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 900, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex decides to not be friends with sam sam would not mind.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex decides to not be friends with Sam, Sam would not mind\" is not necessarily common sense as it makes assumptions about Sam's feelings and reactions without any context or evidence. People's emotions and responses to situations can vary greatly, and it's not universally true that someone would not mind if a friend decided to end the friendship. It depends on the individual's personality, the nature of their relationship, and many other factors. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 901, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex depends upon the level he never improve his level.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that if Alex relies solely on his current level of skill or knowledge without making an effort to improve, he will remain stagnant and not experience growth or advancement. This aligns with the common-sense understanding that progress and improvement require effort, learning, and pushing beyond one's current abilities. Depending solely on one's current level can lead to complacency and hinder development. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 902, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex digs themselves into a hole alex gets into depression.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex digs themselves into a hole, Alex gets into depression\" uses metaphorical language to describe the process of someone getting into a difficult or overwhelming situation and experiencing a negative emotional response as a result. In this context, \"digging themselves into a hole\" suggests that Alex is making decisions or taking actions that lead to worsening circumstances, which could naturally lead to feelings of despair or depression. This idea aligns with common psychological understanding that stress and feeling overwhelmed can contribute to mental health struggles. Therefore, the statement reflects a reasonable and relatable concept.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 903, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex digs themselves into a hole then morgan would make fun of their situation.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex digs themselves into a hole then Morgan would make fun of their situation\" suggests a specific relationship dynamic between Alex and Morgan where Morgan might mock or tease Alex when they find themselves in a difficult situation. This could be common in relationships where teasing is a form of interaction, but it is not universally applicable or a general rule of human behavior. Whether or not this statement reflects common sense depends on the nature of Alex and Morgan's relationship, which is not detailed in the statement. Without further context, it is unreasonable to assume that this statement reflects common sense as it is based on specific interpersonal dynamics.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 904, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex digs themselves into a hole they remain silent assuming someone will eventually come for them.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that Alex, when faced with a difficult situation (represented metaphorically by \"digging themselves into a hole\"), chooses to remain silent and wait passively for help, rather than actively seeking a solution or asking for assistance. This approach may not always be practical or advisable, as it relies on the assumption that others will notice the problem and intervene, which may not happen. Being proactive and communicating about the issue is generally a more effective way to address challenges. Therefore, I would argue that this statement does not represent common sense, as it promotes passivity over taking action.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 905, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex discusses later in the chapter they will learn.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex discusses later in the chapter they will learn\" suggests that discussing the material will lead to learning. This aligns with common educational theories that emphasize active engagement and discussion as effective learning strategies. Discussing material can help deepen understanding, clarify doubts, and reinforce memory through interaction and feedback. Therefore, it seems logical to conclude that if Alex participates in discussions about the chapter, they are likely to enhance their learning experience.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 906, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex discusses later in the chapter they will not give away the ending.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex discusses later in the chapter they will not give away the ending\" suggests that Alex is mindful about revealing spoilers or crucial conclusions of the story. It is common sense that when discussing parts of a book or a chapter, one would avoid giving away the ending to ensure that the suspense and interest in the story is maintained for those who have not finished it yet. This respects the reader's experience and allows them to discover the ending on their own. Therefore, the statement aligns with the general practice of preserving the surprise element in storytelling. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 907, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex discusses later in the chapter they will not learn.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex discusses later in the chapter they will not learn\" seems to lack a clear logical connection. Discussing a chapter could actually enhance learning by clarifying concepts, engaging with the material, and stimulating critical thinking. Therefore, discussing a chapter later does not necessarily imply that learning will not occur. The statement seems to overlook the potential benefits of discussion as a learning tool. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 908, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex discusses later in the chapter they will skip right to the end.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex discusses later in the chapter they will skip right to the end\" suggests that Alex would skip the intervening content to jump to the end of a chapter upon discussing later parts of it. This scenario seems context-dependent and could vary based on the individual's reading habits or the structure of the material being discussed. In general, discussing content from later in a chapter doesn't necessarily imply skipping directly to the end, as one might still review or read through the material comprehensively. Therefore, the statement does not universally align with common sense as it assumes a specific behavior that might not apply to all situations or individuals.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 909, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex does well for oneself then they will acquire joy and satisfaction.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex does well for oneself then they will acquire joy and satisfaction\" is based on the idea that success and personal achievement lead to positive emotions and fulfillment. This is a common belief that aligns with psychological concepts such as self-efficacy and the fulfillment of personal goals. When individuals accomplish their objectives or perform well in their endeavors, it often leads to increased self-esteem and happiness. This is because achieving personal goals can provide a sense of purpose and validation. Therefore, the statement reflects a generally accepted principle that personal success is linked to emotional well-being. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 910, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex does well for oneself they will brag to people about how much better they are.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that if Alex is successful, they will boast about their superiority to others. This is a subjective claim that may not apply to everyone named Alex or to every person in general. People's reactions to their own success can vary greatly based on their personality, values, and upbringing. Some might choose to brag, while others might be more humble or private about their achievements. Therefore, it is not accurate to generalize this behavior to all individuals who do well for themselves.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 911, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex does well for oneself they will look for ways to thank the people who helped them get to where they are now.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that if someone achieves success, they will acknowledge and show gratitude to those who contributed to their accomplishments. This idea aligns with the general principle of reciprocity and appreciation, which is commonly recognized as a positive and ethical behavior. Expressing gratitude is often seen as a way to maintain good relationships and to recognize the support and efforts of others. Therefore, the idea that someone would want to thank those who helped them succeed can be considered as common sense as it reflects widely held values of gratitude and recognition. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 912, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex does well for oneself they will save their earnings for the future.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex does well for oneself they will save their earnings for the future\" suggests that financial prudence and planning for the future are natural consequences of doing well financially. It is common sense to expect that someone who is doing well financially would want to secure their financial future by saving some of their earnings. This reflects a basic understanding of the importance of saving for unforeseen circumstances and future needs, which is a widely accepted financial principle. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 913, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex does well for oneself they will squander their earnings away foolishly.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex does well for oneself they will squander their earnings away foolishly\" is not necessarily common sense. Common sense would suggest that someone who does well for themselves might be financially responsible and prudent with their money. The statement makes an assumption about Alex's behavior without considering individual factors such as financial literacy, personal values, or past behavior. Therefore, it is not accurate to generalize this outcome for everyone who does well for themselves.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 914, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex draws alex's conclusions alex is ignorant about the issue.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that drawing one's own conclusions inherently leads to ignorance on an issue, which is not necessarily true. Drawing conclusions based on careful consideration of available evidence and different perspectives can lead to a well-informed understanding of an issue. The act of drawing conclusions does not automatically equate to ignorance; rather, the quality and breadth of information considered are key factors. Therefore, the statement itself is not rooted in common sense as it overlooks the importance of informed and critical thinking in forming conclusions.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 915, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex draws alex's conclusions to show the fraud manner.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex draws Alex's conclusions to show the fraud manner\" is somewhat unclear and ambiguous, making it difficult to assess its common sense value. It appears to suggest that Alex is using his own conclusions to demonstrate or prove fraudulent behavior, but the logical connection and the context in which this takes place are not specified. Additionally, the phrasing \"draws Alex's conclusions\" is unusual and does not follow typical logical or grammatical structure.\n\nWithout additional context or clarification, it is challenging to determine whether this statement represents a common-sense approach to addressing fraud or if it lacks rational coherence. However, based on the information provided and the confusing nature of the statement, it does not clearly align with common-sense reasoning.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 916, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex eats all of alex's food sometime disturb.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex eats all of Alex's food, sometime disturb\" is unclear and lacks a logical connection between the two parts of the sentence. It is not clear what \"sometime disturb\" refers to or how it is causally related to Alex eating all of his food. Common sense statements usually involve a clear and understandable cause-and-effect relationship or a widely accepted truth. Since this statement does not provide a clear link or context, it does not align with common sense principles. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 917, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex eats all of alex's food they will be full.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex eats all of Alex's food they will be full\" is based on the general understanding that consuming a sufficient amount of food typically leads to a feeling of fullness. When a person eats, the stomach expands and signals to the brain that it has received enough food, which results in the sensation of being full. Therefore, assuming the portion of food is adequate for Alex's dietary needs, it is reasonable to expect that eating all the food would make Alex full.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 918, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex eats all of alex's food very egarly to eat.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex eats all of Alex's food very eagerly to eat\" is not a logical or coherent statement. It appears to be an incomplete conditional sentence that lacks a clear consequence or result. Additionally, the phrase \"very eagerly to eat\" is grammatically incorrect and unclear. Therefore, the statement does not convey a meaningful or common-sense idea.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 919, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex eats healthier he also considers excercise sleep quality and other important aspects of wellness.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that if Alex makes healthier eating choices, he is also likely to consider other aspects of wellness such as exercise and sleep quality. This makes sense because making positive changes in one area of health can often encourage an individual to adopt a more holistic approach to their overall well-being. People who are conscious about their diet are often more aware of the importance of maintaining balance in other areas of health to achieve optimal results.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 920, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex eats healthier he stops exercising.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex eats healthier, he stops exercising\" does not align with common sense because eating healthier and exercising are both components of a healthy lifestyle and are typically encouraged together to promote overall well-being. Generally, individuals who are motivated to eat healthier are also motivated to maintain or increase their level of physical activity, rather than stopping exercise. Therefore, the statement suggests a counterintuitive relationship between healthy eating and exercise. \nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 921, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex eats healthier they will continue to try to maintain their healthy diet longterm.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex eats healthier they will continue to try to maintain their healthy diet longterm\" is based on the idea that positive habits can lead to sustained behavior changes. When someone starts to see the benefits of a healthier diet, such as increased energy and better overall health, they are more likely to be motivated to maintain these habits. This can create a positive feedback loop where the benefits reinforce the behavior. However, long-term maintenance of a healthy diet also depends on other factors such as personal motivation, support systems, and access to healthy food options. Therefore, while it is common for healthier eating to encourage continued efforts, it is not guaranteed.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 922, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex eats healthier they will eat badly the following day.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex eats healthier they will eat badly the following day\" is not necessarily common sense, as it implies a direct and inevitable correlation between eating healthy one day and eating badly the next day. Eating habits can vary greatly from person to person, and there is no inherent rule or natural tendency that dictates a person must eat poorly after a day of healthy eating. It largely depends on individual choices, circumstances, and overall dietary patterns. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 923, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex eats sam's bread he would feel remorseful and apologize.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex eats Sam's bread he would feel remorseful and apologize\" involves assumptions about Alex's moral values and sense of responsibility. It suggests that Alex understands that taking someone else's food without permission is wrong and would feel guilty about it. Additionally, it implies that Alex values his relationship with Sam and would want to make amends by apologizing. This scenario is common in everyday social interactions where respecting others' belongings and making amends for mistakes are generally accepted behaviors. Therefore, the statement aligns with common social norms and expectations about ethical conduct and accountability.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 924, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex eats sam's bread they will neglect to tell them that so that sam can replace the bread.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement implies that Alex would hide the fact that they ate Sam's bread, in order for Sam to unknowingly replace it. This behavior could be considered deceitful or dishonest as it involves not communicating the truth and taking advantage of Sam's unawareness. Common sense would suggest open communication and honesty in such a situation, where Alex should inform Sam that they ate the bread and perhaps offer to replace it themselves. Therefore, the statement does not align with common sense principles of honesty and communication.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 925, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex eats sam's bread they will tell sam that they are going to need to get more bread.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement implies that Alex will inform Sam about the need to replenish the bread supply after consuming it, which is a considerate and responsible action. It demonstrates good communication and accountability between the two parties. This behavior is generally expected in most social situations where sharing resources is involved, as it helps maintain harmony and ensures that everyone's needs are met. \n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 926, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex enforces alex's rights he is ensuring justice.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex enforces Alex's rights he is ensuring justice\" is contingent upon the nature of the rights being enforced and the manner in which they are enforced. Enforcing one's rights can contribute to justice if those rights are legitimate and the enforcement is conducted in a fair and lawful manner. However, if the rights being enforced are unjust or the method of enforcement infringes upon the rights of others, then it does not necessarily ensure justice. Justice involves a balance of rights and responsibilities among all parties, so the mere act of enforcing one's own rights does not automatically guarantee that justice is being served.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 927, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex enforces alex's rights then he will do it poorly.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex enforces Alex's rights then he will do it poorly\" is not necessarily common sense because it makes an assumption about Alex's ability to enforce his rights without providing any context or evidence to support that assumption. Common sense would suggest that an individual's ability to enforce their rights effectively depends on various factors such as knowledge of the law, available resources, and personal skills, rather than being an inherent characteristic of the individual. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 928, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex enforces alex's rights they would be justified the situation at hand called for it.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that enforcing one's rights is justifiable when the situation demands it, which is a common principle in legal and ethical contexts. People have the right to protect their interests and ensure fair treatment, especially when facing circumstances that challenge their rights. The assertion aligns with the idea of self-defense or standing up for oneself when necessary. Therefore, it can be considered a reflection of common sense, as it promotes the idea of taking appropriate action to safeguard one's rights in response to specific situations.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 929, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex explains alex's reasons it will make sense.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex explains Alex's reasons it will make sense\" suggests that clarity and understanding can be achieved through explanation. This is a common principle in communication, as explaining one's reasoning can help others understand the perspective and logic behind actions or decisions. Thus, it is reasonable to expect that if Alex provides a clear and logical explanation of their reasons, it will make sense to others. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 930, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex explains alex's reasons it won't make ssense.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that Alex's reasons will not be comprehensible to others. However, without knowing the context or the specific reasons being discussed, it is difficult to definitively say whether Alex's explanations will lack sense. It's possible that Alex's reasons could be complex or difficult to understand, but it's also possible that with clear communication, they could make sense to others. Therefore, the assumption that Alex's explanations will not make sense is not necessarily a common sense conclusion.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 931, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex explains alex's reasons they would be incoherent ramblings.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex explains Alex's reasons they would be incoherent ramblings\" suggests that Alex's explanations or reasoning skills are not clear or logical. However, without specific information about Alex's communication skills or the context in which Alex is explaining their reasons, it is not reasonable to assume that their explanations would automatically be incoherent. It is important not to generalize or make assumptions about someone's abilities without sufficient evidence. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 932, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex falls around sam and grabs onto them pulling them down too.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement describes a scenario where Alex falls near Sam and instinctively grabs onto them, pulling them down as well. This behavior could be a reflexive action as a person might instinctively reach out for something to stabilize themselves when falling. It could be considered common sense that in a moment of losing balance, a person might unintentionally cause someone else to fall if they are within reach and are grabbed in an attempt to regain stability.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 933, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex falls around sam but instead puts their hands out to brace themselves before the hit the ground not pulling anyone down.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement describes a scenario where Alex falls but takes measures to prevent pulling anyone else down by putting their hands out to brace themselves. This action demonstrates self-awareness and consideration for others' safety, which can be seen as common sense. Common sense would suggest taking actions to minimize harm to oneself and others in an accidental fall. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 934, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex falls around sam might think of which to hand it.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex falls around Sam might think of which to hand it\" is not clear and lacks coherence, making it difficult to understand the intended meaning or context. The phrasing is awkward and the relationship between \"Alex falling\" and \"Sam thinking of which to hand it\" is not logically established. The statement also leaves ambiguity in terms of what \"it\" refers to and what action Sam is considering.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 935, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex feeds the fish he poke the fish with his finger.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex feeds the fish he poke the fish with his finger\" does not seem to align with common sense. Feeding fish typically involves providing food to the fish, not physically poking them with a finger. Poking fish could potentially harm them or cause them stress, which is counterproductive to the act of feeding and caring for them. Therefore, the statement appears to be illogical and not based on common sense.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 936, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex feeds the fish he will do so from a distance.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex feeds the fish he will do so from a distance\" may not be considered common sense without additional context. Common sense would typically suggest that feeding fish involves being close enough to the water to effectively distribute the food. However, if there are specific circumstances such as the fish being in a large or hazardous pond, or if Alex has a tool that allows him to feed the fish from a distance, then the statement could make sense. But without such context, the statement does not align with typical expectations of how fish are fed. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 937, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex files for bankruptcy then morgan would ask alex for a loan.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex files for bankruptcy then Morgan would ask Alex for a loan\" does not align with common sense. Filing for bankruptcy typically means that an individual is unable to pay their debts and is seeking legal relief from those debts. As a result, someone in bankruptcy would not be in a position to lend money to others. It would be illogical for Morgan to ask Alex for a loan under these circumstances, as Alex would not have the financial means to provide one. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 938, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex fills alex's glass he won't think to drink from the glass even if he feels thirsty.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement seems to lack common sense because typically, when someone fills a glass with a drink, it is a natural and logical action to drink from it, especially if they are feeling thirsty. The act of filling the glass usually implies the intention to drink from it. The statement contradicts typical human behavior and reasoning in a common situation.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 939, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex finds a book to read they will break their glasses.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex finds a book to read they will break their glasses\" does not seem to follow common sense. Typically, finding a book to read does not have a direct correlation with breaking one's glasses. Breaking glasses usually results from accidents or mishandling, not from the act of finding a book. The cause (finding a book) and the effect (breaking glasses) in the statement do not logically connect based on everyday experiences and understanding.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 940, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex finds a book to read they will find a quiet place to read it.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex finds a book to read they will find a quiet place to read it\" is based on the assumption that people generally prefer a quiet environment for reading, as it can help with concentration and comprehension. This preference for a quiet place while reading is a common behavior observed in many individuals, making the statement align with general expectations and norms. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 941, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex finds alex's parents alex won't even recognize any similar physical traits that he shares with his parents.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that Alex would not recognize any similar physical traits between himself and his parents, which seems unlikely given that children often inherit physical characteristics from their parents. Recognizing such traits typically doesn't require specialized knowledge or close familiarity, as even subtle resemblances in facial features, hair color, or other attributes can be noticeable. Therefore, it would be unusual for Alex not to recognize any similarities at all. \n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 942, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex finds alex's parents for showing his angry towards them.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement lacks clarity and coherence, making it difficult to determine if it is common sense. The phrase \"showing his angry towards them\" is not grammatically correct, which further obscures the meaning of the statement. Additionally, the context and motivation behind Alex's actions are not explained, making it challenging to assess the sensibility of the statement. Therefore, it is not possible to determine if it is common sense based on the information provided.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 943, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex finishes the project alex will have more time for the family.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex finishes the project, Alex will have more time for the family\" is based on the assumption that completing the project will free up time that was previously dedicated to working on the project. This would logically allow Alex to allocate that newly available time to other activities, such as spending time with family. This is a reasonable assumption and aligns with common sense, as finishing a task typically reduces one's obligations and can create more leisure time.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 944, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex finishes the project alex will laugh at himself.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex finishes the project, Alex will laugh at himself\" does not align with common sense as it suggests an unusual reaction to completing a project. Typically, one might expect feelings of relief, satisfaction, or happiness upon finishing a project, rather than laughing at oneself. The statement does not provide a logical or typical connection between completing a project and the reaction described. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 945, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex flies across the room they would crash into the wall from the slippery floor.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex flies across the room they would crash into the wall from the slippery floor\" is not common sense for a few reasons. Firstly, the use of the word \"flies\" is ambiguous and unrealistic as humans cannot fly. It suggests an exaggerated or metaphorical scenario rather than a literal one. Secondly, a slippery floor would typically cause someone to slip and fall rather than propel them through the air to crash into a wall. The cause (slippery floor) and the effect (flying into a wall) are not logically connected in a typical understanding of how slippery floors affect movement. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 946, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex flies across the room they would fly into a wall.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex flies across the room they would fly into a wall\" is based on the assumption that Alex would continue in a straight line until they encounter an obstacle, such as a wall. In most indoor environments, walls typically define the boundaries of a room, so if Alex were to fly across the room, it's logical to conclude that they would eventually encounter a wall if there is no other intervention or change in direction. This assumes that the room is enclosed and Alex does not have the ability to maneuver or stop before reaching the wall. Therefore, the statement can be considered common sense as it aligns with basic principles of motion and spatial boundaries. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 947, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex flies across the room they would fly straight into a wall.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex flies across the room they would fly straight into a wall\" assumes that there are walls surrounding the room and that Alex is flying in a straight line directly toward one of the walls. In most typical room setups, walls enclose the space, so if someone were to fly across it, they would eventually encounter a wall if they continued in a straight line. Therefore, the statement relies on the common understanding of the physical layout of a room and the consequences of flying in a confined space. \n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 948, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex flies across the room they would go through the window.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex flies across the room they would go through the window\" assumes that Alex has the ability to fly, which is not a common human ability. Additionally, the statement implies that if Alex were to fly across the room, their trajectory would be directed towards the window and the window would not be able to stop them. This scenario seems highly improbable and unrealistic given normal human capabilities and the typical strength of windows. Therefore, the statement does not align with common sense, which is based on practical judgment and everyday experiences.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 949, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex flies across the room they would win that race faster than expected.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex flies across the room they would win that race faster than expected\" suggests an unrealistic scenario where a human, Alex, is capable of flying. In real life, humans do not have the ability to fly unaided, so the premise itself is illogical and not based on common sense. Common sense relies on practical and sound judgment based on everyday experiences and flying across a room is not within the realm of normal human capabilities.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 950, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex flies across the room they'll be careful not to break anything.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex flies across the room they'll be careful not to break anything\" suggests an unlikely scenario where a human, Alex, is capable of flying. In real life, humans do not have the ability to fly unaided, so the premise itself is unrealistic. However, the latter part of the sentence about being careful not to break anything demonstrates a concern for safety and responsibility, which is a common sense approach when moving around objects.\n\nGiven the fantastical nature of the scenario, it is not rooted in common sense as it defies the laws of physics and human capabilities. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 951, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex gets a parking ticket in the park.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex gets a parking ticket in the park\" implies that parking regulations are enforced in the park, and that Alex has potentially violated those rules by parking improperly or without the necessary permits. It is common for parks to have parking regulations to manage traffic, preserve the environment, and ensure safety. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that getting a parking ticket in the park could happen if regulations are not followed. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 952, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex gets a parking ticket vehicle registration will be held pending.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that if Alex receives a parking ticket, there will be a hold on his vehicle registration until the ticket is addressed or resolved. This is a common practice in many places, as unpaid parking tickets can result in consequences such as holds on vehicle registration renewal to ensure compliance with traffic laws and prompt payment of fines. This procedure encourages individuals to resolve their outstanding tickets in a timely manner to avoid further complications with their vehicle registration.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 953, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex gets a second job they start slacking off at both their first and second job assuming either of the job will not fire them.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement assumes that Alex will slack off at both jobs simply because they have taken on a second job, which is not necessarily true. Each individual's work ethic and ability to manage multiple responsibilities can vary. Some people are able to handle multiple jobs without compromising their performance at either, while others may struggle. Additionally, the statement assumes that Alex believes they won't be fired from either job, which may not be the case as job security often depends on performance. Therefore, it is not appropriate to generalize this behavior to everyone who takes on multiple jobs.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 954, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex gets back home he thinks he'll never leave again.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that Alex believes that once he returns home, he will want to stay there permanently and not leave again. This could be due to a variety of reasons such as comfort, safety, or emotional attachment to the place. However, without further context about Alex's circumstances or reasons for feeling this way, it is difficult to determine if this statement reflects common sense. Common sense would typically dictate that future decisions are influenced by changing circumstances and new experiences, making such an absolute statement uncertain. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 955, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex gets back home they will be safe in the house.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex gets back home they will be safe in the house\" assumes that the home is a secure environment, which is generally a common belief. Homes are typically designed to provide shelter and security from external threats, so it is reasonable to assume that being in one's home increases safety. However, this statement could be context-dependent, as safety can also be influenced by other factors such as the location of the home, the presence of hazards within the home, or external threats that could breach the home's security. Despite these considerations, in a general context, it is common sense to think of a home as a safe place. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 956, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex gets back home they will stay outside.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex gets back home they will stay outside\" seems contradictory because typically when someone gets back home, they would go inside rather than stay outside. The statement does not align with common expectations or behavior when someone returns to their home. Therefore, it does not appear to be based on common sense.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 957, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex gets bad news morgan will speak sarcastically about alex 's bad news.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex gets bad news, Morgan will speak sarcastically about Alex's bad news\" assumes a specific reaction from Morgan without providing context about their relationship, personality, or past behavior. It is not common sense to assume that someone will react sarcastically to bad news, as people can have a range of emotional responses depending on their empathy, maturity, and the nature of their relationship with the person receiving the bad news. Additionally, speaking sarcastically about someone's misfortune is generally considered insensitive, and it is not a universally expected reaction. Therefore, it is not common sense to assume this specific reaction from Morgan without more information.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 958, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex gets bad news they will feel upset.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex gets bad news they will feel upset\" is based on the common emotional response people have to negative information. It is typical for individuals to feel upset or distressed when they receive bad news, as it can trigger feelings of sadness, disappointment, or worry. This emotional response is a natural human reaction to unfavorable events or information.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 959, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex gets coffee and drinks it right away his tongue might be burned.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement reflects a common understanding that hot beverages, such as coffee, can cause burns if consumed immediately after being served at a high temperature. It is a widely recognized safety precaution to allow hot drinks to cool down slightly before drinking to prevent burns. This is a practical piece of knowledge based on the physical properties of heat transfer and the sensitivity of the human body to high temperatures.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 960, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex gets coffee and lets it cool down or puts milk in it before drinking it it won't burn his tongue.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement is based on the idea that letting coffee cool down or adding milk can reduce its temperature, which in turn reduces the likelihood of burning one's tongue. Both letting coffee cool and adding milk are commonly known methods to cool down a hot beverage. The lower temperature would make it more comfortable and safer to drink. Therefore, the statement is built on a logical and widely understood principle.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 961, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex gets coffee he will be able to work faster.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex gets coffee he will be able to work faster\" is based on the idea that caffeine, a stimulant found in coffee, can increase alertness and improve concentration, which may lead to increased productivity and faster work pace. This is a commonly observed effect of caffeine consumption for many people. However, the effect of caffeine can vary from person to person, and some individuals may experience negative effects such as increased anxiety or jitteriness which could actually hinder their work performance. Therefore, while the statement could be true for some individuals, it is not universally applicable to everyone.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 962, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex gets coffee he will pour the coffee on the grass.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex gets coffee he will pour the coffee on the grass\" does not seem to align with common sense. Typically, when someone gets coffee, they drink it rather than pour it onto the grass. Pouring coffee on the grass would be considered wasteful and unusual behavior. Common sense would suggest that the coffee is meant for consumption rather than being discarded in such a manner. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 963, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex gets full so they continue to eat more.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex gets full so they continue to eat more\" does not align with common sense because generally, when a person is full, it indicates that their body has had enough food and they should stop eating. Continuing to eat after feeling full can lead to discomfort and potential health issues. Therefore, it is not logical or typical behavior to keep eating after reaching fullness.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 964, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex gets full they would not feel good.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex gets full they would not feel good\" seems to imply that overeating or reaching fullness might lead to discomfort. In general, it is common knowledge that eating beyond one's capacity can result in physical discomfort such as bloating, indigestion, or nausea. Therefore, the statement aligns with the typical understanding that overeating can cause discomfort. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 965, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex gets on an empty train they believe its empty because no one wants to ride with them.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that Alex interprets an empty train car as a reflection of their own lack of desirability as a companion, which may not necessarily be the case. An empty train could be due to a variety of reasons such as the time of day, the specific route, or other external factors unrelated to Alex's presence. It is not common sense to immediately assume that an empty train is a result of people not wanting to ride with them, as this interpretation ignores other plausible explanations. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 966, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex gets some friends alex will engage in activities that are both fun and healthy e g tennis.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that having friends can lead to engaging in activities that are both enjoyable and beneficial for one's health, using tennis as an example. This is based on the idea that social interactions can encourage participation in group activities or sports, which are often fun and promote physical health. It is common sense that friends can influence one's choices and that social activities can be both enjoyable and good for health.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 967, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex gets some friends alex will suggest an activity that is costly and not productive.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex gets some friends Alex will suggest an activity that is costly and not productive\" is not necessarily common sense, as it makes assumptions about Alex's preferences and behavior without any context or evidence. Common sense would suggest that individual preferences and behaviors can vary widely, and that having friends does not automatically mean someone will suggest costly and unproductive activities. Additionally, the statement is overly specific and generalizes Alex's behavior based on a single condition (having friends), which may not be accurate or fair.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 968, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex gets the food he won't even know to eat the food even if he is hungry.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that Alex lacks the basic instinct or knowledge to eat when hungry, even when food is available. This is not consistent with common human behavior, as hunger typically triggers the natural response to seek and consume food. Therefore, the statement does not reflect common sense, as it contradicts a basic human instinct. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 969, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex gets the letter alex would not read it.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex gets the letter, Alex would not read it\" implies that even if Alex receives the letter, Alex would choose not to read it. This statement lacks context about why Alex would not read the letter. There could be various reasons such as disinterest, illiteracy, or a prior decision to avoid certain correspondence. Without more information about Alex's motivations or circumstances, it's difficult to assess whether this statement is common sense. Common sense typically relies on general knowledge or practical reasoning that most people would agree with, which isn't clear in this case due to missing context. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 970, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex gets the letter they will throw it in the trash without looking at it.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex gets the letter they will throw it in the trash without looking at it\" is not necessarily common sense, as it depends on a variety of factors including Alex's attitude towards receiving letters, the source of the letter, and the context in which the letter is received. Without knowing these specifics, it's difficult to determine if this behavior is typical or expected. Additionally, common sense would suggest that most people would at least glance at a letter before deciding to discard it, to ensure they are not missing any important information. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 971, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex gives sam a box then morgan would assume that they are getting a box as well.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement does not necessarily exhibit common sense as it assumes that Morgan has an expectation of receiving a box based solely on observing Alex give a box to Sam. This assumption may not be valid as it depends on the relationship dynamics and previous experiences among Alex, Sam, and Morgan. Without further context that suggests Morgan has a reason to expect a box when Sam receives one, the statement seems to be an arbitrary assumption.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 972, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex gives sam a box they would throw the box away.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex gives Sam a box they would throw the box away\" is not necessarily common sense. The outcome of the statement depends on the context and the relationship between Alex and Sam, as well as the contents or value of the box. Without additional information, it is not possible to determine if Sam would indeed throw the box away simply based on the fact that it was given by Alex. Common sense would suggest considering these factors before assuming the outcome.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 973, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex gives sam a box what can i do with this.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex gives Sam a box what can I do with this\" is not inherently common sense. The statement is ambiguous and lacks context, making it difficult to determine what actions can be taken with the box or what relevance the box has to the person asking the question. Common sense typically involves practical judgment and clear reasoning that can be easily understood, but this statement does not provide enough information to facilitate that. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 974, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex gives sam a trial it will be meaningful.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex gives Sam a trial it will be meaningful\" is not necessarily common sense without additional context. The meaningfulness of the trial would depend on various factors such as the nature of the trial, the relationship between Alex and Sam, and the purpose or outcome expected from the trial. Without knowing these details, it is difficult to determine whether the trial would indeed be meaningful. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 975, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex gives sam a trial it will be unrealistic.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex gives Sam a trial it will be unrealistic\" is not necessarily common sense without additional context. The reasoning behind the statement's truth or falsehood depends on what type of trial is being referenced and the relationship or roles between Alex and Sam. If the trial is referring to a judicial or legal trial and neither Alex nor Sam are qualified legal professionals, then it could be considered unrealistic. However, if the trial refers to a different scenario, such as a trial period for a job or a test of skill, the statement may not hold. Without specific information about the nature of the trial and the qualifications of Alex and Sam, it is difficult to determine if it is common sense.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 976, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex gives sam a trial they would allow sam to give their point of view of the situation.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that giving someone a trial provides them with an opportunity to present their perspective on a situation. This aligns with the basic principles of fairness and justice, where individuals are given the chance to defend themselves and share their side of the story. In legal and interpersonal contexts, it is commonly accepted that allowing individuals to express their viewpoint is crucial for reaching a just and informed resolution.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 977, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex gives sam flowers they will give sam poppies and sam is allergic to poppies.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that giving Sam flowers will result in them receiving poppies, to which they are allergic. It is not common sense to give someone something they are allergic to, as it can cause harm and discomfort. Therefore, it would be considerate and sensible to avoid giving Sam poppies or any flowers that could potentially include poppies.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 978, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex gives sam help sam should be angry about it.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex gives Sam help, Sam should be angry about it\" does not align with common sense. Generally, when someone offers help, it is seen as a kind gesture and is typically appreciated by the recipient. Being angry in response to receiving help would be considered an unusual or irrational reaction unless there are specific underlying reasons that make the help unwelcome or inappropriate. Therefore, it is not common sense to expect someone to be angry when they are being helped.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 979, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex gives sam help they will get angry and storm off.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex gives Sam help they will get angry and storm off\" does not seem to be rooted in common sense without further context. Common sense would suggest that a person would typically appreciate receiving help, unless there is a specific reason why they would react negatively, such as a strained relationship or a desire for independence. Without additional information about the relationship between Alex and Sam or Sam's personality and preferences, it is not reasonable to assume that offering help would universally lead to anger and storming off. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 980, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex gives sam instruction it will likely make a lot of sense.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex gives Sam instruction it will likely make a lot of sense\" assumes that Alex is knowledgeable and capable of providing clear and sensible instructions. Without additional context about Alex's expertise or the nature of the instruction, it's difficult to determine the accuracy of the statement. Common sense would typically require some knowledge of Alex's qualifications or the subject matter. Therefore, the statement itself is not necessarily common sense as it lacks sufficient context.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 981, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex gives sam instruction it will most likely be wrong.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex gives Sam instruction it will most likely be wrong\" is not necessarily a matter of common sense, as it involves making an assumption about Alex's ability to provide correct instructions without any context or evidence. Common sense typically relies on general knowledge, practical reasoning, and basic understanding that is widely accepted. Without knowing more about Alex's expertise or track record in giving instructions, it would be unfair and illogical to conclude that the instructions would likely be wrong based solely on the statement. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 982, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex gives sam one dollar than sam only has one dollar.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex gives Sam one dollar then Sam only has one dollar\" assumes that Sam has no other money and is only left with the one dollar given by Alex. This is not necessarily true, as Sam could have other money or sources of income. Therefore, the statement is not common sense because it overlooks other possibilities regarding Sam's financial situation. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 983, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex gives sam one extra debit card and their pin.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex gives Sam one extra debit card and their pin\" is not common sense because sharing a debit card and PIN with someone else can compromise the security of one's bank account and personal finances. It is generally advised to keep such information private and secure to prevent unauthorized access and potential financial loss. Therefore, sharing a debit card and PIN with another person goes against basic security practices and is not considered a sensible action. \n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 984, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex gives sam one money sam will have no idea what to do with the money.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that Sam lacks knowledge or experience in handling money. However, without any further context about Sam's financial literacy or background, it is difficult to determine the accuracy of the statement. It's possible that Sam may know exactly what to do with the money, or may not. Therefore, the statement cannot be considered common sense as it relies on an assumption without any supporting information. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 985, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex gives sam one sam will assume there are more.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that Sam has a tendency to assume there are more of something when given just one by Alex. This could be common sense if it is based on prior experiences or patterns of behavior observed in Sam. If Sam has consistently shown a tendency to expect more when given one item in the past, it would be reasonable to assume that this behavior would continue. However, without specific context or information about Sam's behavior, it is difficult to definitively say this is common sense, as it may not universally apply to all situations or individuals. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 986, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex gives sam one they tell them by when they want the favor returned.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex gives Sam one they tell them by when they want the favor returned\" implies that there is an expectation for a favor to be returned by a specific time when one person does a favor for another. This can vary depending on the relationship between the individuals and the nature of the favor. In many cases, favors are done without an explicit expectation of when they should be returned, and are based more on goodwill and mutual assistance. While it might make sense in certain contexts (like a formal agreement or a business context), it is not a universal rule in casual or personal relationships. Therefore, it does not represent common sense as it does not apply universally to all situations of giving and receiving favors.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 987, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex gives sam the slip alex will go to a bad part of town and get into trouble.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests a cause-and-effect relationship between Alex giving Sam the slip and Alex ending up in a bad part of town and getting into trouble. However, the connection between these events is not necessarily logical or based on common sense. Giving someone the slip typically means evading or avoiding them, but it does not inherently lead to going to a bad part of town or getting into trouble. Additional context or information would be needed to establish a more sensible link between these actions and consequences. Without further justification, the statement does not align with common sense.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 988, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex goes car shopping he she will buy the first car without shopping around and not negotiate a better price.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement assumes that Alex will buy the first car they see without considering other options or negotiating for a better price, which may not necessarily be true for everyone. Different individuals have different approaches to making major purchases, such as car shopping. Some may prefer to compare options and negotiate, while others may make quicker decisions. Without additional information about Alex's specific shopping habits or preferences, it is not reasonable to assume this behavior applies universally to them.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 989, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex goes down in flames he is likely to succeed.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex goes down in flames he is likely to succeed\" seems contradictory, as the phrase \"goes down in flames\" typically implies failure or a disastrous outcome. To succeed usually means to achieve a desired goal or outcome, which is the opposite of failing. Therefore, the statement does not align with common sense, as it presents two opposing ideas as being directly related. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 990, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex goes down in flames it is because they flew too close to the sun.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex goes down in flames it is because they flew too close to the sun\" is metaphorical and likely alludes to the Greek myth of Icarus, who flew too close to the sun with wings made of wax, causing the wax to melt and leading to his downfall. This metaphor is commonly used to describe someone who fails due to overreaching or excessive ambition. Therefore, the statement suggests that if Alex fails, it will be due to their own excessive ambition or risk-taking. This metaphorical interpretation is widely understood, making the statement a form of common sense in warning against the dangers of overreaching. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 991, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex goes sam's separate ways they will not meet.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex and Sam go separate ways, they will not meet\" is based on the logical understanding that if two individuals choose different paths or directions, their routes will not intersect, and therefore, they will not encounter each other. This follows a basic principle of spatial relationships and movement. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 992, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex goes sam's separate ways they would lead happy productive lives.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex and Sam go their separate ways they would lead happy productive lives\" is not necessarily common sense as it is based on a hypothetical situation and does not take into account the complexities of individual happiness and productivity. Happiness and productivity are subjective and can be influenced by a multitude of factors beyond the nature of their relationship. Additionally, the statement assumes that their current relationship is hindering their happiness and productivity, which may not be the case. Therefore, the assumption that separating would automatically lead to positive outcomes for both individuals is overly simplistic.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 993, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex goes sam's separate ways they would leave sam alone.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that if Alex and Sam go their separate ways, Alex will no longer be in Sam's company, and as a result, Sam will be left alone. This is a logical assumption based on the idea that separating from someone leads to not being together anymore. Therefore, it is common sense that Sam would be alone if Alex goes separate ways.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 994, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex goes sam's separate ways they would still cause trouble for one another.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that regardless of physical separation, Alex and Sam would continue to negatively impact each other, possibly due to unresolved conflicts or a deep-seated animosity. This implies an ongoing, pervasive issue between them that cannot be resolved merely by distance. In reality, separation can often help diffuse tension and reduce direct conflicts. Without further context on the nature of their relationship and the specific troubles they cause for each other, it's difficult to definitively agree with the statement. It leans towards a pessimistic view of their interactions and assumes an inherent, unchangeable propensity to cause trouble, which may not be the case.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 995, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex goes to the zoo with sam's family sam's family ignore alex.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex goes to the zoo with Sam's family, Sam's family ignores Alex\" does not necessarily reflect common sense, as it is based on an assumption about the behavior of Sam's family without providing context or reasoning for why they would ignore Alex. Common sense would suggest that if Alex is invited to join Sam's family at the zoo, they would likely be inclusive and engage with Alex during the outing. Ignoring Alex would be considered rude and not typical behavior for a family spending time together with a guest. Therefore, the statement does not align with common sense expectations of social interactions in such a scenario.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 996, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex goes to the zoo with sam's family the family would force and push alex into the lion exhibit hoping that the lions and alex would become friends.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that a family would endanger someone by forcing them into a lion exhibit, which is highly unlikely and dangerous. It is not common for families to intentionally put someone in harm's way, especially in a situation involving wild animals. Additionally, it is not realistic to expect lions and humans to become friends in such a scenario. Therefore, the statement does not align with common sense.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 997, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex goes to the zoo with sam's family they ignore morgan.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex goes to the zoo with Sam's family they ignore Morgan\" is not necessarily common sense. Common sense typically refers to sound practical judgment or general knowledge that is widely understood and accepted. This statement seems to imply a specific dynamic or relationship between Alex, Sam's family, and Morgan, which would not be universally known or understood without additional context. Therefore, it is not something that can be considered common sense.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 998, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex grabs sam's things there might be a face off.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that if Alex takes Sam's belongings without permission, it could lead to a confrontation or disagreement. This is based on the general understanding that taking someone else's possessions without consent can provoke a negative reaction. It's a common social norm to respect others' property, and violating this norm can naturally result in conflict.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 999, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex grabs sam's things they might decide to talk things out.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex grabs Sam's things they might decide to talk things out\" does not necessarily follow common sense. In many situations, grabbing someone's possessions could lead to conflict or escalation rather than a calm and constructive conversation. The act of grabbing someone else's belongings could be seen as aggressive or invasive, which might make the other person feel defensive or upset. Therefore, it is not a reasonable expectation that this action would naturally lead to a decision to talk things out. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 1000, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex grows a set of onions and then stuffs them in the garbage disposal.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "Growing a set of onions typically requires time and effort, so it would not make sense to then dispose of them in a garbage disposal. This would be a waste of resources and contradict the purpose of growing them in the first place, which is to use or consume them. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 1001, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex grows older alex is now wrinkley.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex grows older, Alex is now wrinkly\" is based on the common observation that as people age, their skin tends to lose elasticity and develop wrinkles. This is a natural part of the aging process due to factors such as decreased collagen production, exposure to sunlight, and other environmental influences. Therefore, the statement aligns with general knowledge about aging and its effects on the skin. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1002, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex grows older then they didn't have any birthdays.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex grows older then they didn't have any birthdays\" is not common sense because growing older generally implies the passage of time, which typically includes the celebration of birthdays. Birthdays mark the completion of one year of life and are a direct indication of growing older. Therefore, the two parts of the statement contradict each other: growing older suggests having more birthdays, not having none.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1003, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex hangs a picture they would try using superglue instead of tacs.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The use of superglue or tacs for hanging a picture depends on the specific circumstances such as the type of wall, the weight of the picture, and the permanence of the installation. Superglue is generally not recommended for hanging pictures as it can damage walls and is difficult to remove, while tacs or nails are more commonly used and appropriate for temporary and adjustable placements. Therefore, using superglue instead of tacs for hanging a picture does not align with common practices. \n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1004, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex hangs around sam alex must really intensely hate sam.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex hangs around Sam, Alex must really intensely hate Sam\" does not follow common sense because typically, people spend time with others whom they like or have positive feelings towards. If Alex truly hated Sam, it would be more likely that Alex would avoid Sam rather than choose to spend time around them. The statement presents a contradictory and illogical scenario based on usual social behavior and relationships. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 1005, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex hangs around sam alex would say something that offends sam.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex hangs around Sam, Alex would say something that offends Sam\" is not necessarily common sense. This statement makes an assumption about Alex's behavior without any context or evidence about their relationship, communication style, or past interactions. Common sense would suggest that interactions between individuals are complex and can vary widely, so making a blanket statement about the outcome of their interaction is not reasonable. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 1006, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex has a great boss alex will say good things about their boss.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex has a great boss, Alex will say good things about their boss\" generally aligns with common sense as it is typical for individuals to speak positively about someone they have a favorable opinion of, including in a professional context. If Alex's boss is great, it implies that the boss is supportive, fair, and competent, which are qualities that would naturally lead Alex to express positive sentiments. Therefore, it is reasonable to expect that if Alex genuinely appreciates their boss's qualities and leadership, they would openly share favorable comments.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1007, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex has a great boss they will not work diligently.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex has a great boss they will not work diligently\" seems counterintuitive to common sense. Generally, having a great boss who is supportive, fair, and motivational can encourage employees to work more diligently as they feel valued and appreciated. Positive leadership tends to foster a productive work environment where employees are motivated to do their best. Therefore, the statement does not align with typical workplace dynamics where good leadership usually leads to better employee performance.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1008, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex has a great boss they would not like them.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex has a great boss they would not like them\" seems counterintuitive as generally, having a great boss would lead to a positive working relationship and overall job satisfaction. A great boss typically exhibits qualities such as fairness, supportiveness, and effective communication, which most employees would appreciate. Therefore, it is not common sense to assume that Alex would not like their great boss without further context or specific reasons for personal dislike.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1009, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex has a high fever all he needs to do is to wait for the fever to subside.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement, \"If Alex has a high fever all he needs to do is to wait for the fever to subside,\" may not be common sense because a high fever could be a symptom of a more serious underlying condition that may require medical attention. Simply waiting for the fever to subside without addressing the root cause or monitoring for other symptoms could potentially be harmful. Additionally, there are measures that can be taken to help reduce a fever and make the person more comfortable, such as taking fever-reducing medication, staying hydrated, and resting. It is important to consider these factors and potentially seek medical advice depending on the severity and duration of the fever. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 1010, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex has a high fever get into a hot bath.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex has a high fever, get into a hot bath\" is not common sense. When someone has a high fever, their body temperature is already elevated, and getting into a hot bath could potentially raise their body temperature even further. This could be dangerous and lead to conditions such as heat stroke. It is generally recommended to use cooler methods to help reduce a fever, such as taking a lukewarm bath or using cool compresses. Therefore, getting into a hot bath when having a high fever is not advisable. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 1011, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex has a high fever he is likely to be healthy.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "A high fever is typically a sign that the body is fighting off an infection or illness, indicating that the person may not be in good health. Therefore, the statement \"If Alex has a high fever he is likely to be healthy\" contradicts common medical understanding of the relationship between fever and health. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 1012, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex has a high fever then morgan would take them outside to exercise on a hot day.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "No, the statement does not demonstrate common sense. Common sense would dictate that if Alex has a high fever, it would be best for them to rest and recover indoors, away from heat and strenuous activity that could potentially worsen their condition. Taking someone with a high fever outside to exercise on a hot day could be harmful to their health. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 1013, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex has a high fever they will take lots of tylenol and try to sleep it off.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement, \"If Alex has a high fever they will take lots of Tylenol and try to sleep it off,\" may seem reasonable at first, as taking medication like Tylenol (acetaminophen) can help reduce fever and alleviate discomfort, and rest is often recommended when sick. However, using the term \"lots of Tylenol\" is concerning because it suggests taking an excessive amount of the medication, which can be dangerous and lead to liver damage or other health issues. The recommended approach would be to take Tylenol according to the dosing guidelines provided on the packaging or by a healthcare professional.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1014, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex has an english test tomorrow they would go on an all night video gaming binge.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that Alex would choose to engage in an all-night video gaming binge the night before an English test. Common sense would suggest that it would be more prudent for Alex to spend the night studying or getting a good night's sleep to be well-prepared and alert for the test. Engaging in an all-night gaming binge could lead to fatigue and poor performance on the test. Therefore, the behavior described in the statement does not align with what would be considered a sensible or logical approach to preparing for an exam. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 1015, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex has an english test tomorrow they would review the material for the exam.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex has an English test tomorrow, they would review the material for the exam\" reflects a common sense approach to preparing for an assessment. Generally, individuals who have an upcoming test will review the relevant material to enhance their understanding and performance. Reviewing material is a typical and practical strategy to reinforce knowledge and increase the likelihood of success on the test. Therefore, the statement aligns with typical behavior in an academic context. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1016, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex has never cooked before they may burn their food.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex has never cooked before they may burn their food\" is based on the idea that lack of experience can lead to mistakes or mishaps in a new activity. Cooking requires certain skills and knowledge, such as understanding temperature control, timing, and how to properly handle ingredients. Without prior experience or knowledge, it is more likely for someone to make errors, such as burning food. This is a reasonable assumption based on general knowledge about learning new skills.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1017, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex has never cooked before they may look up recipes online.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that someone with no prior cooking experience, like Alex, might seek guidance through online recipes to help them start cooking. This is a logical and practical approach, as the internet is a widely accessible resource that offers a vast array of information, including recipes for beginners. Therefore, the statement aligns with common sense, as it reflects a typical and sensible action that one might take when faced with a lack of experience in a certain task.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1018, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex has sam by the balls he would have no chance since he's weaker and smaller.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement appears to be making an assumption about physical strength and size determining the outcome of a confrontation. However, it is important to consider that there are many factors that can influence the outcome of a situation, such as skill, agility, strategy, and mental resilience. Additionally, the phrase \"has sam by the balls\" is a colloquial expression that could be interpreted in different ways, and does not necessarily imply a literal physical advantage. Therefore, it is not accurate to assume that the statement is common sense as it oversimplifies a complex situation. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 1019, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex hears a strange noise they will not inspect.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement, \"If Alex hears a strange noise they will not inspect,\" suggests that Alex's reaction to hearing a strange noise would be to avoid investigating it. This could be considered a common sense response depending on the context. If Alex perceives the noise as potentially dangerous or threatening, it would be reasonable for them to prioritize their safety by not inspecting the source of the noise. On the other hand, if the noise is simply unfamiliar but not necessarily threatening, avoiding an inspection might not be the typical response. Since the statement does not specify the nature of the noise or the circumstances, it is difficult to definitively say if it is a common sense reaction. However, erring on the side of caution could be seen as a sensible approach. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1020, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex immediately tried he would ask for a return of favor.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that if Alex were to immediately try something, he would expect a reciprocal favor in return. This implies a sense of quid pro quo or an understanding of mutual benefit in relationships or interactions. While it is not universally true that everyone would expect a favor in return, it is common for people to expect some form of reciprocation in various social and professional contexts. Therefore, the statement reflects a common social norm or expectation. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1021, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex immediately tried he would move on.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that taking immediate action, such as trying or making an effort, could lead to progress or resolution for Alex. This aligns with the common understanding that proactive behavior often leads to positive change or forward movement in various situations. Whether it's overcoming a challenge, achieving a goal, or moving past a difficult situation, taking the initiative is generally seen as a beneficial approach. Therefore, the statement reflects a practical and reasonable perspective.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1022, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex immediately tried to drive a car after putting the key in the ignition and turning it on.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement describes a typical sequence of actions that a person would take when attempting to drive a car: putting the key in the ignition and turning it on, then trying to drive. This is a common and logical progression, as a car generally needs to be turned on before it can be driven. It reflects a basic understanding of how to operate a vehicle.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1023, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex invites people over they will forget to give them directions.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex invites people over they will forget to give them directions\" is not necessarily common sense. Common sense would suggest that someone inviting guests over would typically remember to provide directions, or that the guests would ask for directions if they were not initially given. The statement makes an assumption about Alex's behavior without any context that supports this as a consistent or general truth. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 1024, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex is a country music star alex will resort to drugs and alcohol until it becomes a serious addiction problem.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement assumes that being a country music star inherently leads to drug and alcohol abuse, which is a stereotype and not necessarily true for every individual in the industry. Many country music stars lead healthy, balanced lives without resorting to substance abuse. The statement also generalizes the behavior of one person to an entire profession, which is not a fair or accurate representation. Additionally, addiction is a complex issue influenced by various factors, including genetics, mental health, and environment, and cannot be solely attributed to one's profession.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1025, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex is a country music star alex will save the newly obtained money remain humble and enjoy it while it lasts.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that if Alex becomes a country music star, he will save the money he earns, remain humble, and enjoy his success while it lasts. This statement is based on hypothetical behavior and does not necessarily reflect common sense, as individual responses to fame and financial success can vary greatly. People may react differently based on their values, upbringing, and personal circumstances. Therefore, assuming that all country music stars, including Alex, would behave in this specific manner is not a universally applicable or predictable outcome.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1026, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex is a country music star they will say to a reporter that they hate all their fans.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement does not align with common sense because it is generally unlikely for a public figure, such as a country music star, to openly express negative sentiments towards their fans, who are essential to their success and popularity. Public figures typically aim to maintain a positive image and good relationships with their supporters. It would be counterproductive for a country music star to say they hate all their fans, as it could damage their reputation and career. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 1027, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex is a country music star they would wear cowboy hats and boots on stage.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex is a country music star they would wear cowboy hats and boots on stage\" draws on common stereotypes associated with country music performers. Cowboy hats and boots are widely recognized as traditional elements of country music fashion, often worn by artists in the genre to reflect cultural roots and appeal to the genre's audience. However, not all country music stars adhere to this style, and individual fashion choices can vary greatly. Despite this variation, the general association of cowboy hats and boots with country music performers is well-known. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1028, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex is a football player they would not wear a helmet.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex is a football player they would not wear a helmet\" does not align with common sense, given that helmets are a standard and essential piece of safety equipment in football. Helmets are used to protect players from head injuries during the physical contact inherent in the sport. Therefore, it is expected and required for football players to wear helmets while playing.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1029, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex is a freshman in college they would drop out.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex is a freshman in college they would drop out\" is not necessarily common sense, as it makes an assumption about an individual's likelihood of dropping out based solely on their status as a freshman. Many factors influence a student's decision to drop out, such as academic performance, financial concerns, personal issues, and level of support. It is not reasonable to generalize that all freshmen, including Alex, would drop out without considering these individual circumstances. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 1030, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex is a little boy person two does not know he is.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex is a little boy, person two does not know he is\" seems to suggest a specific lack of knowledge or awareness on the part of person two about Alex's age or status as a little boy. Without additional context, it's difficult to assess whether it's common sense since common sense would typically dictate that a person's age or status as a child is generally observable or known to those interacting with them. This statement seems to imply an unusual circumstance where person two is unaware of something that might otherwise be considered evident. Therefore, this statement does not align with what is typically considered common sense. \n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1031, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex is able to escape he will get away.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex is able to escape he will get away\" is tautological in nature because it suggests that if Alex is successful in escaping, then by definition he has gotten away. Escaping implies getting away from a situation or place, so if Alex accomplishes the act of escaping, it logically follows that he has gotten away. Therefore, the statement is essentially restating the same idea in two different ways, making it an example of common sense.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1032, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex is able to escape they will be caught again.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex is able to escape they will be caught again\" implies that even if Alex manages to escape, there is a high likelihood or certainty of being recaptured. This could be considered common sense if there are strong security measures or surveillance in place that would make it difficult for Alex to remain free after escaping. Additionally, if Alex has been caught before, it suggests that the authorities are capable of capturing them again. \n\nHowever, without specific context about the security measures, the resources available to the authorities, or Alex's abilities and resources, it's challenging to definitively say this statement is common sense. It's a conditional statement that depends on various factors which are not provided. \n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1033, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex is able to escape they will escape quietly.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex is able to escape they will escape quietly\" suggests that if Alex has the capability to escape, they would do so in a discreet manner. This could be considered common sense in a situation where escaping quietly would increase the likelihood of a successful escape by avoiding detection. However, the statement is conditional and context-dependent, as there could be scenarios where escaping quietly may not be possible or necessary. Despite this, the general idea that someone would choose a quiet escape to avoid attention when feasible aligns with logical thinking.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1034, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex is able to escape they will tell the guards.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex is able to escape they will tell the guards\" seems counterintuitive to common sense. Generally, if someone is escaping, they would want to avoid alerting the guards to increase their chances of a successful escape. Telling the guards would likely lead to recapture. Therefore, the statement does not align with typical reasoning in a scenario involving escape. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 1035, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex is driving alex's car on the highway alex is driving under the influence of alcohol.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement assumes that Alex is always driving under the influence of alcohol when driving on the highway, which is not a reasonable or common assumption. People can drive their cars on the highway without being under the influence of alcohol, and assuming that someone is always under the influence when driving is not a fair or accurate judgment. Such a statement also lacks evidence or context that would justify making such a claim about Alex's behavior.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1036, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex is driving alex's car on the highway alex leaves the door ajar.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex is driving Alex's car on the highway, Alex leaves the door ajar\" does not align with common sense because leaving the door ajar while driving on the highway would be unsafe. It could lead to potential accidents or injuries as the open door could interfere with the vehicle's stability and aerodynamics. Additionally, it is generally expected that all doors should be securely closed while the vehicle is in motion for safety reasons.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1037, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex is driving alex's car on the highway they will not look before changing lanes.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that Alex will not look before changing lanes while driving on the highway, which would be considered unsafe and irresponsible behavior. Generally, it is common sense for drivers to check their mirrors and blind spots before changing lanes to ensure it is safe to do so. Not doing so could lead to accidents and endanger the safety of Alex as well as other drivers and passengers on the road. Therefore, the statement does not align with what is typically considered common sense for safe driving practices. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 1038, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex is driving alex's car on the highway they're going 30 mph over the speed limit.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement, \"If Alex is driving Alex's car on the highway they're going 30 mph over the speed limit,\" does not necessarily imply common sense. Common sense suggests that driving behavior and speed depend on individual choices, traffic conditions, and adherence to traffic laws, rather than being predetermined by the mere fact of someone driving their own car. Therefore, it is not a universally applicable or logical assumption that Alex would always be driving 30 mph over the speed limit just because they are driving their own car on the highway. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 1039, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex is feeling a little cold they would drink ice water.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex is feeling a little cold they would drink ice water\" does not align with common sense reasoning. Typically, when someone is feeling cold, they would seek to warm themselves up rather than consume something cold like ice water. Drinking ice water would likely exacerbate the feeling of coldness rather than alleviate it. A more common response would be to drink something warm, like tea or coffee, or to wear warmer clothing. \n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1040, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex is feeling a little hot they must have sat on the kitchen stove with no pants on.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement does not represent common sense. Common sense refers to sound practical judgment concerning everyday matters or a basic ability to perceive, understand, and judge in a manner that is shared by most people. The idea that someone feeling hot must be due to sitting on a stove with no pants is illogical and an extreme conclusion. There are many other common and likely reasons someone might feel hot, such as being in a warm environment, exercising, or wearing heavy clothing. Therefore, the statement does not align with common sense reasoning.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1041, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex is feeling a little hot they will open the window.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex is feeling a little hot, they will open the window\" is based on a logical response to feeling hot, which is to seek relief by allowing cooler air from outside to enter the room. Opening a window is a common and simple action to help regulate temperature and increase comfort. Therefore, this action aligns with a typical response to the sensation of feeling hot.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1042, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex is getting a raise alex will hold a party.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex is getting a raise, Alex will hold a party\" is not necessarily common sense, as it relies on specific assumptions about Alex's behavior and preferences. Common sense would suggest that receiving a raise could lead to a celebration, but whether or not Alex chooses to hold a party depends on individual factors such as personality, financial considerations, and personal circumstances. It is not a universally applicable or predictable outcome for everyone who receives a raise. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 1043, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex is getting a raise and the other will think of improvement.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex is getting a raise and the other will think of improvement\" is not necessarily common sense because it assumes a causal relationship between Alex getting a raise and another person thinking of improvement without providing context or explanation for why one would lead to the other. It is not inherently logical or obvious that someone else would consider improving just because Alex receives a raise. The statement lacks clarity and specifics about who \"the other\" is and what kind of improvement they are considering. Therefore, it does not align with the typical understanding of common sense, which generally involves clear, sound judgment based on simple perception of the situation or facts.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1044, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex is getting a raise he or she might think which way to tread.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex is getting a raise he or she might think which way to tread\" suggests that receiving a raise might lead Alex to consider their next steps or decisions carefully. This could be common sense because a raise often brings new responsibilities or expectations, and one might need to think about how to handle these changes effectively. Additionally, a raise might impact one's financial situation, prompting considerations on how to manage or invest the additional income.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1045, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex is in a lot of trouble alex will feel relieved.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex is in a lot of trouble, Alex will feel relieved\" does not align with common sense. Typically, when someone is in trouble, they experience feelings of stress, anxiety, or worry rather than relief. Relief is usually felt when trouble is resolved or avoided. Therefore, the statement contradicts the usual emotional response one would expect in such a situation.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1046, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex is in a lot of trouble he cry and give up.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex is in a lot of trouble he cry and give up\" is not necessarily common sense because it assumes a specific reaction from Alex without considering individual differences in coping mechanisms and resilience. People respond differently to trouble and adversity based on various factors such as personality, past experiences, and support systems. Some might cry and give up, while others might seek help, problem-solve, or persevere through challenges. Assuming that Alex will always cry and give up when faced with trouble is an overgeneralization and does not account for the complexity of human behavior. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 1047, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex is on a road trip he she is careful to start the trip with a well maintained vehicle.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "Starting a road trip with a well-maintained vehicle is a practical and safety-conscious decision. It helps prevent breakdowns and accidents on the road, ensuring a smoother and more reliable journey. This consideration is commonly advised for anyone planning a long drive. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that being careful to start with a well-maintained vehicle is a common-sense approach to road trips.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1048, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex is on the baseball team they would bet against themselves.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that if Alex is on the baseball team, they would engage in unethical behavior by betting against their own team. In general, it is not common sense to assume that someone would engage in such behavior simply based on their participation in a team. This paints an unfair and unfounded negative assumption about Alex's character without any evidence. Additionally, betting against one's own team is typically against sportsmanship and team ethics. \n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1049, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex is sam's last day they will be very sad.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that if a particular day is Alex's last day with Sam, they will experience sadness. This implies an emotional response to separation or an ending, which is a common human experience. People often feel sad when they part ways with someone they have a connection with, whether it be a friend, family member, or colleague. Therefore, the statement aligns with a typical emotional reaction to such situations.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1050, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex is terrible at math they will get a tutor.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex is terrible at math they will get a tutor\" is based on a logical response to address a specific need for improvement in a subject area. It is a common approach for individuals who are struggling academically to seek additional help, such as tutoring, to better understand the material and improve their skills. This intervention can provide personalized assistance and support, which can be very beneficial for someone who finds a subject challenging. Therefore, the statement aligns with a practical solution that is often employed in such situations.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1051, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex is the best gift sam had ever gotten then they have no concept of what a present truly is.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement implies that Alex, presumably a person, is not an appropriate or valuable gift and that Sam's understanding of what constitutes a good present is flawed if they consider Alex as the best gift. This could be seen as a subjective opinion and may not align with common sense as it dismisses the emotional or personal value that Sam might see in Alex. Common sense would suggest that the value of a gift can vary greatly depending on personal relationships and individual perspectives.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1052, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex is the best gift sam had ever gotten to waste the time.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex is the best gift Sam had ever gotten to waste the time\" does not seem to be a common-sense statement. Firstly, referring to a person, Alex, as a gift is unusual and metaphorical. Secondly, describing a gift's purpose as \"to waste the time\" is not typical, as gifts are generally given to be cherished or appreciated, not to waste time. Therefore, the statement seems illogical and does not align with common understanding or practical reasoning.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1053, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex is wearing a swimsuit they wear it to the grocery store during grocery day shopping.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement does not represent common sense because wearing a swimsuit to a grocery store is not typical or socially appropriate attire for that setting. Grocery stores generally expect patrons to wear regular clothing that covers the body adequately. Swimsuits are designed for swimming or beach activities and are not suitable for running errands in public places like grocery stores. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 1054, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex is wearing a swimsuit wear a modest one piece.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests wearing a modest one-piece swimsuit if Alex is wearing a swimsuit. This could be seen as a suggestion for modesty or appropriateness in certain settings, such as family-friendly environments or specific cultural contexts. However, without further context about the location, the event, or personal preferences, it is difficult to determine if it's common sense. Personal choice in swimwear can vary widely depending on individual comfort, style, and the norms of the specific social setting. Therefore, the statement is not necessarily common sense as it assumes a universal standard for modesty without considering individual or situational factors. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 1055, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex joins sam's band they would make the top 10 charts within days.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex joins Sam's band they would make the top 10 charts within days\" is not necessarily common sense, as it lacks supporting evidence or context. Success in the music charts depends on various factors such as the band\u2019s overall talent, the quality of their music, their marketing strategies, and the appeal to their target audience. Simply adding a new member to a band does not guarantee such rapid success. Without further information about Alex's influence, skills, or the current status of Sam's band, this statement is speculative.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1056, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex joins the chess club they will know how to play the game and look forward to competing.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement assumes that joining the chess club implies that Alex already knows how to play chess and is eager to compete. However, this may not necessarily be true. Alex could be joining the chess club to learn how to play or to improve their skills, and might not yet be interested in competing. It's also possible that Alex is joining for social reasons or other motivations unrelated to playing proficiency or competition enthusiasm. Therefore, the statement makes assumptions that may not apply to every individual's situation.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1057, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex joins the chess club they will look for someone to play cards with.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement does not necessarily follow common sense as chess and card playing are different activities with different sets of skills and interests. Joining a chess club typically implies a focus on playing and improving in chess, not searching for card game partners. Therefore, there may not be a direct link between joining a chess club and looking for someone to play cards with. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 1058, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex justifies alex's actions he would keep mute and be proud.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex justifies Alex's actions he would keep mute and be proud\" suggests that if Alex finds reasons to defend his actions, he would remain silent and feel pride. This could be interpreted as Alex being confident in his decisions, feeling no need to explain himself further, and experiencing self-satisfaction from his justification.\n\nHowever, justifying one's actions does not necessarily lead to remaining silent or feeling pride. People might justify their actions and still engage in discussions or express regret, or they might not feel proud even if they believe their actions were justified. The statement assumes a specific emotional response and behavior that does not universally apply to all situations of self-justification.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1059, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex justifies alex's actions he would report himself after that.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex justifies Alex's actions he would report himself after that\" suggests that if Alex finds his actions justifiable or acceptable, he would then report himself. This seems contradictory, as typically one would only report oneself if they believed their actions were wrong or against rules. Justifying one's actions generally means that the person believes their actions were right or permissible, which would not logically lead to self-reporting. Therefore, the statement does not align with common sense.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1060, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex keeps sam under control he would ask him for favors.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests a causal relationship between keeping someone under control and asking for favors, which is not necessarily a common sense connection. In general, asking for favors does not depend on controlling someone, and controlling someone does not imply that favors will be asked. The statement seems to imply a manipulative or coercive dynamic, which is not a typical or healthy basis for asking for favors in most social or professional relationships.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1061, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex keeps sam under control sam would be in good hands.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that if Alex is able to manage or supervise Sam effectively, then Sam will be well taken care of. This implies that Alex is responsible and capable enough to provide the necessary support or guidance for Sam. Whether this is common sense would depend on the context and the individuals involved. If Alex has a track record of being responsible and caring, then it would be common sense to believe that Sam would be in good hands under Alex's control. However, without knowing more about Alex's capabilities and the nature of their relationship, it's hard to definitively say it's common sense. Therefore, the assumption that Sam would automatically be in good hands just because they are under Alex's control might not necessarily be common sense universally. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 1062, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex keeps sam under control sam would be put in danger.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex keeps Sam under control, Sam would be put in danger\" is not necessarily common sense, as it lacks context and clarity. The relationship between keeping someone under control and putting them in danger is not inherently logical and could depend on various factors such as the nature of control and the specific circumstances. Without additional information about what \"keeping under control\" entails and how it would lead to danger, it is difficult to assess the validity of the statement based solely on common sense. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 1063, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex keeps up sam's spirits by making fun of sam.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that making fun of someone can uplift their spirits, which is generally not a common sense approach. While lighthearted teasing among friends can sometimes be a bonding experience, making fun of someone can often be hurtful and have a negative impact on their self-esteem and emotional well-being. The context and nature of the interaction, as well as the individuals' relationship and personalities, play crucial roles in determining whether making fun of someone could be perceived positively or negatively. However, as a general statement, it is not common sense to assume that making fun of someone will keep their spirits up.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1064, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex keeps up sam's spirits he use actions.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex keeps up Sam's spirits he use actions\" suggests that Alex uses actions to maintain or uplift Sam's spirits. In general, actions can effectively influence someone's emotional state, as they can include supportive gestures, kind words, or helpful deeds. This idea aligns with common sense because it recognizes that actions often speak louder than words and can have a tangible impact on someone's feelings and well-being.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1065, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex keeps up sam's spirits he use words.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex keeps up Sam's spirits he use words\" is not necessarily common sense. The phrasing is awkward and unclear, making it difficult to interpret the intended meaning. It seems to suggest that Alex uses words to uplift Sam's spirits, but the connection between the two actions is not explicitly stated. The statement could be more clearly articulated to convey a more logical cause-and-effect relationship, such as \"Alex uses encouraging words to keep up Sam's spirits.\" Additionally, there could be other ways to uplift someone's spirits, such as through actions or gestures, that do not involve words. Therefore, the statement as it stands does not align with common sense due to its ambiguity and lack of clarity.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1066, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex kills sam's brother and makes sure to keep quiet and hide all the evidence.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that if Alex commits murder and takes steps to cover it up, the crime would remain undiscovered. This is not common sense because it assumes that hiding evidence and remaining silent guarantees that the crime will not be uncovered, which is not necessarily true. Investigations can uncover hidden evidence and other means of discovering the truth exist. Therefore, the statement does not reflect a sound or practical judgment.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1067, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex kills sam's brother he would brag about it in the street.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex kills Sam's brother he would brag about it in the street\" suggests that Alex would publicly boast about committing a serious crime, which is not a typical or rational behavior. Most individuals would understand the legal and moral consequences of such an action and would not openly admit to it, let alone brag about it. Additionally, the statement is a hypothetical scenario that doesn't provide context or evidence of Alex's character or past behavior that would support such a claim.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1068, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex kills sam's brother he would try to cover his tracks.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex kills Sam's brother he would try to cover his tracks\" is based on the assumption that someone who commits a serious crime like murder would want to avoid being caught and facing consequences. This is a logical and reasonable assumption, as most individuals would not want to face legal repercussions or moral condemnation for their actions. Therefore, the statement aligns with common sense as it reflects a typical human behavior of self-preservation and avoidance of punishment.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1069, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex lands a job he would brag about it.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex lands a job he would brag about it\" suggests that Alex would feel proud and want to share his achievement with others. This is a common reaction for many people when they achieve something significant, such as securing a job. Therefore, the statement aligns with typical human behavior and can be considered common sense as it reflects a natural tendency to share positive news. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1070, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex lands a job he would focus on it.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex lands a job he would focus on it\" suggests that securing a job would lead to a commitment to concentrate on work responsibilities. This is generally expected as focusing on a job is essential for success and fulfilling one's duties. It is a common sense expectation that individuals prioritize their work to achieve performance goals and job stability. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1071, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex lands a job they will arrive early the first day of work to make a good impression.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement reflects a common approach to starting a new job, where arriving early on the first day can demonstrate a strong work ethic and commitment to the position. It's a way for Alex to show their enthusiasm and professionalism, which are qualities that most employers appreciate. This behavior is often advised in career guidance resources as a way to make a positive initial impression.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1072, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex lands a job they will come into work late the first day.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex lands a job they will come into work late the first day\" suggests that Alex would be irresponsible or not punctual on their first day of work. This assumption is not necessarily common sense, as most individuals aim to make a good impression on their first day of a new job by being on time or even early. There is no inherent reason to believe that Alex would be late without additional context about their behavior or circumstances.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1073, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex laughs alex's head off alex is sad.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex laughs Alex's head off Alex is sad\" is not common sense because it involves an illogical or physically impossible scenario where someone laughs so hard that their head detaches from their body. Additionally, the statement suggests that such an extreme reaction would lead to sadness, which is contradictory as laughter is typically associated with happiness or amusement. Therefore, the statement does not align with common sense or logical reasoning.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1074, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex laughs alex's head off the would walk away.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex laughs Alex's head off then he would walk away\" is not a common sense statement. The phrase \"laughs one's head off\" is a figurative expression meaning to laugh very hard or uncontrollably, and it does not literally imply that someone's head would detach from their body. Additionally, if someone were to literally lose their head, they would not be capable of walking away as it would be a fatal event. The statement is illogical and not based on common sense understanding of human anatomy or expressions. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 1075, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex leaves the building they will be cautious and look both ways before crossing the street.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that Alex will exercise caution and vigilance when crossing the street, which is generally considered a common-sense safety measure to avoid accidents. Looking both ways before crossing the street is a basic safety rule taught to ensure personal safety by being aware of potential oncoming traffic. Therefore, the behavior described in the statement aligns with commonly accepted safety practices. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1076, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex leaves the living room he will leave the lights on.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex leaves the living room he will leave the lights on\" suggests a specific behavior by Alex, but it doesn't necessarily reflect a common or sensible action. Typically, it is considered responsible and energy-efficient to turn off lights when leaving a room to conserve electricity and reduce energy costs. Therefore, leaving the lights on when leaving a room would not align with common practices of energy conservation.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1077, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex leaves the living room he will turn off the lights.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex leaves the living room he will turn off the lights\" suggests a responsible action to conserve electricity and is reflective of common practice in many households to save energy and reduce costs. It is a logical and environmentally conscious decision, which many people would consider sensible and prudent. Therefore, it aligns with what is commonly accepted as a reasonable action. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1078, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex leaves the living room he would get confused on what's next.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex leaves the living room he would get confused on what's next\" suggests that Alex relies on being in the living room for some sort of orientation or context for subsequent activities. However, without additional information about Alex's specific circumstances or reasons for potential confusion, this statement cannot be universally accepted as common sense. Common sense would dictate that leaving a room should not inherently cause confusion about subsequent activities unless there are specific factors at play such as cognitive impairments, unfamiliar surroundings, or other unique circumstances specific to Alex. Therefore, in general, this statement would not be considered common sense.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1079, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex leaves the living room they would turn off the lights and the television.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex leaves the living room they would turn off the lights and the television\" implies that Alex is being energy-conscious and environmentally responsible by turning off appliances that are not in use. This is a sensible and practical action to take in order to conserve energy and reduce electricity bills. Therefore, it can be considered a common-sense behavior to turn off lights and electronics when leaving a room to avoid unnecessary energy consumption.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1080, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex leaves town he will be arrested because he forgot to check in with his probation officer.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement is based on the implication that Alex is under a probation agreement which likely includes specific terms and conditions he must adhere to, such as regularly checking in with a probation officer. If he leaves town without permission, this could be considered a violation of his probation terms. Being arrested for violating probation terms is a common consequence. Therefore, the statement aligns with the logical consequences of violating probation rules.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1081, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex leaves town he will have fun visiting friends because he let his probation officer know his location.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that Alex is on probation and needs to inform his probation officer about his whereabouts. By letting his probation officer know his location, Alex complies with the terms of his probation, which allows him to travel without facing legal consequences. This compliance likely gives him peace of mind and the freedom to enjoy his time with friends. Therefore, the statement logically connects informing the probation officer with having fun while visiting friends. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1082, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex leaves town they get lost in the country.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex leaves town they get lost in the country\" suggests that Alex lacks the necessary skills or tools to navigate rural areas successfully. However, it's not necessarily common sense as it assumes Alex's abilities without specific evidence. People's ability to navigate varies greatly depending on their familiarity with the area, access to maps or GPS, and experience in traveling. Without knowing more about Alex's skills or preparedness, it's not reasonable to assume they would automatically get lost.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1083, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex leaves town they have a pre planned route.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex leaves town they have a pre planned route\" suggests that Alex has thought ahead and organized a specific path or direction for their travel. This can be considered common sense as it is generally practical and safe to plan a route in advance when traveling, especially to unfamiliar places, to avoid getting lost or encountering unforeseen issues. It also helps in managing time and resources effectively during the journey.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1084, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex looks into sam's face and asks them to leave sam will leave.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex looks into Sam's face and asks them to leave, Sam will leave\" assumes a specific reaction from Sam based on Alex's action, but it doesn't take into account various factors that could influence Sam's response, such as the relationship between Alex and Sam, the context of the situation, and Sam's personal feelings or intentions. Human behavior is complex and can't always be predicted by a simple cause-and-effect statement. Therefore, it is not common sense to assume that Sam will definitely leave just because Alex asks them to in a particular manner. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 1085, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex looks into sam's face and tells them the sun revolves around the earth sam will think they are unintelligent.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement in question posits a scenario where Alex makes a scientifically inaccurate claim to Sam, suggesting that the sun revolves around the earth, which is contrary to the well-established scientific fact that the earth revolves around the sun. Common sense, which relies on basic practical knowledge and reasoning abilities, would suggest that making an evidently false statement could lead someone to question the intelligence of the speaker. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that Sam might consider Alex to be lacking in knowledge or intelligence based on the false claim.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1086, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex loses all alex's money alex lies and runs away from the situation.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex loses all Alex's money Alex lies and runs away from the situation\" is not necessarily common sense. Common sense refers to prudent judgment based on simple perception of the situation or facts. The behavior described in the statement, lying and running away, is not a universally expected reaction to losing money. Different individuals may respond differently based on their personal values, coping mechanisms, and circumstances. Therefore, assuming that this specific behavior will occur in all cases of losing money is not a matter of common sense, but rather a specific assumption about an individual's behavior. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 1087, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex loses all alex's money he she is wise to be honest and admit it.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that being honest about losing money is a wise decision. Honesty generally helps maintain trust and credibility with others, and admitting mistakes can lead to support and assistance in finding a solution. Being honest about financial losses could also help in learning from the experience and making better decisions in the future.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1088, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex loses all alex's money they will get a loan to gamble more.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex loses all Alex's money they will get a loan to gamble more\" may not necessarily reflect common sense. Common sense would suggest that if someone loses all their money, they should reevaluate their financial decisions and avoid further risky behaviors such as gambling. Taking a loan to continue gambling could lead to further financial instability and debt. Therefore, it may not be a prudent or sensible decision.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1089, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex loses all alex's money they will leave the casino and go home.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex loses all Alex's money they will leave the casino and go home\" generally aligns with common sense as it reflects a typical response to losing all available funds for gambling. Without money, one cannot continue to participate in casino games, and it is logical to leave the venue. Additionally, going home can be seen as a responsible decision after experiencing a significant financial loss. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1090, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex loses sam's footing he would be proud.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex loses Sam's footing he would be proud\" does not seem to make common sense, as it is not logical for someone to feel proud about causing another person to lose their footing, which could potentially result in harm or injury. Additionally, the connection between losing footing and feeling proud is not clearly explained or justified in the statement. Therefore, the statement appears to be non-sensical or lacking in rationality.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1091, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex loses sam's footing he would offer a solution to recovering it or to pay for it.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that if Alex is responsible for losing Sam's footing, he would take responsibility by either providing a solution to recover it or compensating for the loss. This portrays a sense of accountability and ethical behavior, which aligns with common social norms and expectations when someone causes a loss or damage to another person's property. It demonstrates taking responsibility for one's actions and making amends, which is generally considered reasonable and sensible behavior. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1092, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex loses sam's footing the first person would be concerned about the second person.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex loses Sam's footing the first person would be concerned about the second person\" is not entirely clear in its meaning, as the phrase \"loses footing\" typically refers to physical stability, and it's not clear how one person can cause another to lose footing. However, interpreting it as Alex causing a situation where Sam loses physical stability or security, it is reasonable to assume that Alex, being the cause of the situation, would be concerned for Sam's well-being. Concern for someone's well-being when you have caused them to be in a precarious situation is a common empathetic response.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1093, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex loses sam's footing then the first person would laugh hysterically at the second person.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement appears to be nonsensical and lacks coherence. The phrase \"alex loses sam's footing\" does not have a clear meaning, as it is unusual to describe one person losing another person's footing. Additionally, the connection between this event and the first person laughing hysterically at the second person is not logically explained. Common sense statements typically have a clear and understandable cause-and-effect relationship, which this statement lacks. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 1094, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex loves sam's performance they will clap in the middle of the performance.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex loves Sam's performance they will clap in the middle of the performance\" may not align with common social etiquette at performances, where clapping is typically reserved for the end of a performance or during designated applause breaks. Clapping in the middle of a performance could be disruptive and is generally not considered appropriate behavior in most formal performance settings. Therefore, loving a performance does not necessarily lead to clapping in the middle of it.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1095, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex mails sam in bulk then sam will die because there are no airholes in the box.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that mailing someone in a box without airholes would lead to suffocation and death due to a lack of oxygen. This is based on the basic physiological need for oxygen to sustain human life. Mailing a person in such a manner is not only unethical but also illegal and dangerous. It is common sense to understand that enclosing a person in a confined space without air supply can be fatal.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1096, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex mails sam in bulk they will decided mailing a person is probably not a sensable idea.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that bulk mailing an individual may lead to the realization that it is not a sensible approach. Common sense would dictate that bulk mailing an individual could be excessive, inefficient, and potentially overwhelming for the recipient, leading to a reevaluation of the method. Additionally, bulk mailing is typically associated with sending generic messages to a large audience, not personalized communication to a single individual, making it an impractical choice. Therefore, the realization that it is not a sensible idea aligns with common sense.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1097, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex maintains sam equilibrium alex would then try to wreak havoc in sam's life in order to create a state of emotional turmoil for sam.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement implies that Alex, after maintaining equilibrium, would actively seek to disrupt Sam's life and cause emotional turmoil. This does not align with common sense, as maintaining equilibrium generally suggests a state of balance and stability. Disrupting someone's life and causing emotional turmoil would contradict the notion of maintaining equilibrium. Additionally, the motivation behind Alex's actions is not clear or justified in the statement, making it further illogical. Therefore, it is not common sense to assume that maintaining equilibrium would lead to such negative behavior.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1098, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex maintains sam equilibrium than alex is holding up their equalibrium in their hands.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement seems to be metaphorical and not necessarily common sense. The phrase \"holding up their equilibrium in their hands\" is likely a figurative way to express maintaining balance or stability. However, the literal interpretation of physically holding equilibrium in one's hands is not possible as equilibrium is a conceptual state, not a physical object. Therefore, the statement appears to be more symbolic rather than rooted in common sense, which typically involves practical and straightforward reasoning.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1099, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex maintains sam equilibrium they will try to knock him down.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that if Alex maintains a state of equilibrium, presumably in a competitive or confrontational context, others (represented by Sam) will attempt to disrupt that balance. This idea aligns with common competitive strategies where opponents often try to destabilize each other to gain an advantage. Therefore, the statement reflects a logical and common understanding of competitive dynamics. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1100, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex makes a friend and says what can we do.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex makes a friend and says what can we do\" is common sense in the context of social interactions. When people make new friends, it is natural for them to want to engage in activities together to strengthen their bond and enjoy each other's company. Asking \"what can we do\" is a typical way to initiate plans and explore mutual interests. It demonstrates openness and willingness to participate in shared experiences, which is a fundamental aspect of building friendships.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1101, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex makes a friend then he can trip them every time he sees them.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex makes a friend then he can trip them every time he sees them\" does not align with common sense or appropriate social behavior. Friendship typically involves trust, respect, and kindness, and tripping someone intentionally is a harmful and disrespectful action. Such behavior would likely damage the friendship and could cause physical injury. Therefore, it is not reasonable or sensible to suggest that making a friend gives someone the right or ability to trip them.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1102, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex makes a friend then hits them in the face.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex makes a friend then hits them in the face\" is not common sense because hitting someone in the face is generally considered aggressive and harmful behavior, which contradicts the typical expectations of friendship. Friendships are usually built on trust, kindness, and mutual respect, and hitting someone goes against these principles. Therefore, the statement does not align with the general understanding of how friendships should function. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 1103, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex makes a impression on sam he always assumes that sam is impressed.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex makes an impression on Sam, he always assumes that Sam is impressed\" suggests that Alex is confident in his ability to make a positive impact on Sam and therefore assumes that Sam is impressed. However, making an impression does not necessarily equate to a positive impression or that Sam is impressed. This assumption by Alex could be seen as overconfident or lacking awareness of Sam's actual feelings or reactions, as impressions can be subjective and vary from person to person. Therefore, the statement may not align with common sense, which would typically encourage a more cautious or realistic approach to understanding others' perceptions.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1104, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex makes a impression on sam he wonders what it is.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex makes an impression on Sam, he wonders what it is\" implies that Sam is unsure or curious about the nature or impact of the impression Alex made on him. This is a possible reaction, as people often reflect on their interactions with others to understand their feelings or thoughts about the encounter. However, it's not a definitive or universal reaction, as some people might instantly recognize and understand the impression made on them without wondering.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1105, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex makes a impression on sam it will be bad because alex ran and hugged sam who spilled the coffee they held all over them.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that Alex's actions of running and hugging Sam caused Sam to spill their coffee, which would likely result in a negative impression. It is common sense that unexpected physical contact, like a sudden hug, can lead to accidents such as spilling something someone is holding. In this context, it is reasonable to assume that Sam might not react positively to the situation, as it resulted in discomfort or inconvenience from the spilled coffee. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1106, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex makes alex's hair tidy neat and clean.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex makes Alex's hair tidy neat and clean\" is not necessarily common sense, as it is more of a conditional statement describing a specific action related to personal grooming. Common sense usually refers to basic practical judgments or widely accepted beliefs that are generally true or expected in most situations. The statement about Alex's hair is a specific action that may or may not be applicable depending on individual circumstances and preferences. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 1107, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex makes it right they cannot make it left.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex makes it right they cannot make it left\" suggests that once a choice is made in one direction, the opposite choice cannot be made simultaneously. This aligns with the basic understanding of mutually exclusive options, where choosing one option excludes the possibility of choosing the other at the same time. For example, if you turn right, you cannot also turn left at the same moment. Therefore, the statement reflects a logical understanding of choices and directions. \n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1108, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex makes no sense they would be confused about what they are saying.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex makes no sense they would be confused about what they are saying\" suggests that if Alex's statements are not logical or clear, they themselves might be confused about the content or meaning of their own communication. This follows a logical reasoning that clarity in expression is often linked to clarity in thought. Therefore, if Alex's statements are incoherent or nonsensical, it is reasonable to infer that Alex might be experiencing confusion about their own thoughts or intentions.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1109, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex makes sam money alex won't even feel that it would be polite for sam to thank alex.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement implies that Alex does not expect gratitude from Sam for giving him money, suggesting that the gesture is not significant enough to warrant a thank-you. This could be interpreted in different ways depending on the context, such as the amount of money given, the relationship between Alex and Sam, and their individual values and expectations. However, generally, it is considered polite and common courtesy to thank someone for a gift or gesture, regardless of the giver's expectations. Therefore, the statement contradicts typical social norms of expressing gratitude.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1110, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex makes sam money they will turn themselves in to the fbi.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex makes Sam money they will turn themselves in to the FBI\" does not appear to be common sense. Common sense would suggest that if someone makes money for another person, they would not necessarily turn themselves in to law enforcement, unless there were illegal activities involved. The statement lacks context and logical connection between making money and turning oneself in to the FBI. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 1111, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex makes sam money they would not give them the money.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that if Alex earns money for Sam, they would not give it to Sam. This seems counterintuitive, as one would generally expect that if Alex makes money on behalf of Sam, they would indeed give the money to Sam. The statement does not follow the typical understanding of fairness and responsibility in handling money for someone else. Therefore, it lacks common sense as it contradicts the expected behavior in such a situation.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1112, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex makes sam's dream come true dream come true's mission is to promote and enrich the lives.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement seems to lack clarity and coherence, making it difficult to determine if it is common sense. The first part of the sentence, \"If Alex makes Sam's dream come true,\" sets up a conditional scenario, but the second part, \"dream come true's mission is to promote and enrich the lives,\" appears to be a separate, incomplete thought that does not logically follow from the first part. The phrase \"dream come true's mission\" suggests an organization or initiative, but it is not clearly defined or connected to the actions of Alex and Sam. Additionally, the phrase \"enrich the lives\" is incomplete and does not specify whose lives are being enriched or in what way. Overall, the statement lacks a clear and logical connection between its parts, making it difficult to assess as common sense. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 1113, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex makes sam's dream come true something you have wanted very much for a long time that has now happened.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement provided appears to suggest that if Alex makes Sam's dream come true, it would fulfill a long-held desire for Sam. This is a logical conclusion, as making someone's dream come true inherently implies fulfilling a significant desire or aspiration that person has held. The statement aligns with a common understanding of what it means to have a dream fulfilled. Therefore, it can be considered as common sense because it is straightforward and aligns with general expectations of the outcome when someone's dream is realized by another person.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1114, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex makes sandwiches he doesn't ask morgan about it.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex makes sandwiches he doesn't ask Morgan about it\" may not necessarily be common sense. The relationship between Alex and Morgan, as well as their roles and responsibilities in making sandwiches, are unknown. If Alex is experienced or prefers to work independently, it might be common for him not to ask Morgan. Conversely, if Morgan has expertise or they typically collaborate, it would be unusual for Alex not to consult Morgan. Without additional context about their dynamic and the situation, it is difficult to determine if the statement aligns with common sense.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1115, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex makes sandwiches than alex knows how to make every type of sandwich in the world.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex makes sandwiches then Alex knows how to make every type of sandwich in the world\" suggests that making any sandwiches implies expertise in making all types of sandwiches. This is not necessarily true, as someone can make basic sandwiches but may not be familiar with or skilled in making specialized or regional sandwiches from around the world. It is an overgeneralization to assume that making some sandwiches equates to knowing how to make all types of sandwiches. Therefore, the statement lacks common sense as it assumes an unrealistic level of expertise based on minimal experience. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 1116, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex makes sandwiches they will starve.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex makes sandwiches they will starve\" seems to imply that Alex is incapable of making sandwiches that are sufficient or edible, leading to starvation. Without additional context about Alex's sandwich-making skills, it's difficult to determine the validity of the statement. It's not common sense to assume someone would starve solely based on who is making the sandwiches, as many factors could be involved, such as the availability of ingredients and the actual ability of Alex to prepare food. Therefore, it seems unreasonable to conclude starvation based solely on the person making the sandwiches. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 1117, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex makes sure it was perfect and reassures everyone that the plans are going well.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that Alex is being responsible and proactive in ensuring that plans are executed well, and is also communicating effectively to keep everyone informed and reassured. This kind of behavior is generally considered sensible and practical in scenarios involving planning and teamwork. It reflects common sense as it helps in maintaining organization and boosting the confidence of everyone involved in the plans.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1118, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex makes sure it was perfect and then ruins the last bit of the plans.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex makes sure it was perfect and then ruins the last bit of the plans\" appears contradictory and not aligned with common sense. Common sense would suggest that if someone ensures something is perfect, they would aim to maintain that perfection rather than deliberately ruin it. The statement describes an illogical action that goes against typical reasoning or practical judgment. Therefore, it does not reflect common sense.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1119, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex makes sure it was perfect it wasn't perfect.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex makes sure it was perfect it wasn't perfect\" seems to suggest a paradoxical situation where the effort to make something perfect actually results in imperfection. This could imply that perfection is unattainable or that the process of striving for perfection introduces flaws. However, this statement is not universally true as it's based on a subjective perspective on perfection and the effectiveness of Alex's efforts. Perfection can be subjective, and the process of verifying perfection does not inherently cause imperfection. Therefore, the statement is not a common-sense assertion as it relies heavily on specific contexts and interpretations of perfection. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 1120, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex makes sure it was perfect then it's perfect.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex makes sure it was perfect then it's perfect\" is contingent on the assumption that Alex has flawless judgment and execution in whatever task is at hand. In reality, no individual can guarantee perfection in all circumstances, as human error and subjective interpretations of \"perfect\" can come into play. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily a common-sense assertion, as it places an unrealistic expectation on an individual's capability. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 1121, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex marries sam's sister alex will become closer to sam.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex marries Sam's sister, Alex will become closer to Sam\" can be seen as common sense in a social and familial context. Marriage often brings families together, creating new bonds and relationships. By marrying Sam's sister, Alex would become Sam's brother-in-law, which is a closer familial relationship than just being friends or acquaintances. This new relationship could lead to more interactions, shared experiences, and a deeper emotional connection between Alex and Sam.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1122, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex marries sam's sister alex will never talk to sam.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex marries Sam's sister, Alex will never talk to Sam\" does not necessarily align with common sense. Marriage typically fosters closer relationships between families, and marrying Sam's sister could potentially strengthen Alex's bond with Sam, as they would become in-laws. The statement assumes a negative outcome without providing context or reasoning for why their communication would cease. Therefore, it is not a common sense statement, as it contradicts the usual expectations of family relationships that are strengthened through marriage.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1123, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex marries sam's sister he will make plans to save and buy a house for a future family.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement implies that Alex is planning for a stable future by considering marriage and homeownership, which are common life goals for many people. Saving and investing in a home indicates a sense of responsibility and long-term planning, which are practical steps when starting a family. The idea of preparing financially for a future family after marriage is a conventional and sensible approach.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1124, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex marries sam's sister it would be a disaster because she's already married.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement is based on the understanding that marrying someone who is already married is not only socially and morally frowned upon, but also legally problematic. Marriage to an already married individual would lead to complications such as bigamy, which is illegal in many places. This situation would likely cause emotional distress and legal issues for all parties involved. Therefore, describing such a scenario as a \"disaster\" aligns with common sensical thinking about the importance of respecting existing marital commitments. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1125, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex marries sam's sister they would both have a rich a fulfilled life.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex marries Sam's sister they would both have a rich and fulfilled life\" is not necessarily common sense, as it makes assumptions about the outcomes of their marriage without considering important factors such as compatibility, communication, and individual aspirations. Fulfillment and wealth in life are influenced by a wide range of factors beyond just whom one marries. Additionally, the statement does not provide evidence or reasoning to support the claim that marrying Sam's sister would specifically lead to a rich and fulfilled life for both individuals. Therefore, it cannot be considered common sense as it lacks a logical foundation and overlooks the complexities of personal relationships and individual fulfillment.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1126, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex meets sam for the time for fight.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex meets Sam for the time for fight\" seems incomplete and lacks context. It is unclear what is meant by \"the time for fight\" and whether this is a planned or spontaneous event. Additionally, the statement does not specify the nature of the fight or whether it is metaphorical or physical. Without further information, it's difficult to determine if this statement represents common sense. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 1127, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex meets sam's friend he start conversation with rage.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex meets Sam's friend he starts conversation with rage\" is not necessarily common sense, as it makes an assumption about Alex's behavior without context or evidence. Common sense would suggest that people's behavior in social interactions can vary widely based on individual personalities, the relationship between the parties involved, and the specific circumstances of the meeting. Without further information about Alex's temperament, history with Sam's friend, or reasons for potential anger, it is not reasonable to assume that Alex would always start a conversation with rage upon meeting Sam's friend. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 1128, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex meets sam's friend they would ask who they were and where they came from.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that if Alex meets Sam's friend, they would inquire about their identity and origin. This is a natural and typical response when meeting someone new, especially if introduced through a mutual acquaintance. Asking such questions helps establish a connection and provides context for the interaction. It is a common social practice to show interest in a new acquaintance by inquiring about their background and identity. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1129, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex moves into a new house alex sleeps outside the lawn.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex moves into a new house, Alex sleeps outside the lawn\" is not common sense. Generally, when people move into a new house, they sleep inside the house, not outside on the lawn. Sleeping outside on the lawn would be unusual and not practical, as it does not provide the comfort and protection that sleeping inside a house does. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 1130, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex moves into a new house they will not live in an apartment.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex moves into a new house they will not live in an apartment\" suggests that moving into a house and living in an apartment are mutually exclusive scenarios. By definition, a house is a standalone building meant for residency, whereas an apartment is a unit within a larger building shared with other units. Therefore, if Alex moves into a new house, it logically follows that Alex will not be living in an apartment because the two types of living situations are distinct. This understanding is based on the common definitions of \"house\" and \"apartment.\"\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1131, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex moves into a new house they would break all the windows.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex moves into a new house they would break all the windows\" does not seem to be based on common sense. Common sense would suggest that someone moving into a new house would take care of the property and preserve its condition, rather than intentionally causing damage. Breaking windows would result in unnecessary costs and inconvenience for repairs, which is not a logical or typical behavior for someone moving into a new home. Therefore, the claim lacks a reasonable basis and does not align with common sense expectations.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1132, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex moves into a new house they would throw a massive party.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex moves into a new house they would throw a massive party\" is not necessarily common sense, as it is based on an assumption about Alex's behavior that may not apply to everyone in a similar situation. Common sense would suggest that moving into a new house could be a reason for celebration, but whether that celebration is a \"massive party\" depends on individual preferences, financial situation, and social habits. Therefore, this statement cannot be universally accepted as common sense. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 1133, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex never found out he would be very suspicious.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex never found out he would be very suspicious\" suggests that Alex would feel suspicious if he remained unaware of certain information or events. This implies that not knowing something would lead him to suspect that something is being hidden from him or that something is amiss. It is common for people to feel uneasy or suspicious when they sense they are being kept in the dark about something important. Therefore, the statement aligns with a typical human reaction to a lack of information in contexts where one might expect to be informed.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1134, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex never found out then they don't need to know.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex never found out then they don't need to know\" suggests that if someone is unaware of specific information or a situation, it might be best to keep it that way, possibly to avoid unnecessary complications or harm. This idea could be considered common sense in scenarios where the information might not be relevant, beneficial, or could potentially cause distress or damage to the person. However, whether this statement is universally applicable as common sense depends on the context and the potential consequences of withholding the information. It is important to assess the situation ethically and consider the impact of not disclosing information to someone who might have the right or need to know. Hence, the statement might be common sense in certain situations but not in others. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 1135, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex offers sam a ride they should follow the map and not their own sense of direction.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that following a map is a more reliable method for navigation than relying on one's own sense of direction. Using a map can provide clear directions and help prevent getting lost, especially in unfamiliar areas. It also implies that there may be a lack of confidence in Sam's sense of direction. Considering these factors, using a map can be seen as a practical and sensible approach to ensure they reach their destination efficiently. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1136, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex offers sam a ride they would make sure they'd both safely arrive at the destination.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement reflects common sense as it implies that Alex, as the driver, takes responsibility for ensuring the safety of both themselves and their passenger, Sam, during the journey. It is a basic expectation that anyone offering a ride to another person would prioritize safety and make efforts to arrive safely at the destination. It is a commonly understood social responsibility for drivers to ensure the safety of their passengers.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1137, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex passes sam examination he will thank sam.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex passes Sam's examination he will thank Sam\" implies that Alex is expressing gratitude towards Sam, possibly because Sam helped him prepare for or administer the examination. It is a common social norm to express gratitude when someone has helped you achieve something. Therefore, it makes sense that Alex would thank Sam if he believes Sam played a role in his success.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1138, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex pays sam debts he will feel relieved and relaxed.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that paying off debts will lead to feelings of relief and relaxation, which is a common psychological response. When debts are paid, it often reduces stress and anxiety associated with financial obligations, leading to a sense of relief. Additionally, feeling relaxed could be a natural consequence of having fewer financial burdens. Therefore, the statement aligns with a typical emotional response to resolving debt.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1139, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex pays sam debts he would request for another loan.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests a pattern of behavior where paying off debts leads to requesting more loans, possibly indicating financial dependency or mismanagement. This behavior may not apply universally to everyone but could be true for specific individuals who continuously rely on borrowing. Whether it's common sense depends on the broader context of their financial habits and reasons for borrowing. However, the statement itself does not provide enough information to definitively determine if it is a common sense scenario universally.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1140, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex performs alex's work it is done early and well prepared.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex performs Alex's work it is done early and well prepared\" suggests that Alex is responsible and diligent in completing tasks. The implication is that Alex has a strong work ethic and consistently meets or exceeds expectations. This could be considered common sense if we have prior knowledge or evidence of Alex's work habits and performance. However, without any context about Alex's capabilities or reliability, it would be an assumption to say that the work is always done early and well-prepared just because Alex does it. Therefore, whether or not this statement is common sense would depend on additional information about Alex's track record. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 1141, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex performs alex's work might not think of which to hand it.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex performs Alex's work might not think of which to hand it\" is somewhat confusing and lacks clarity. It seems to suggest that if Alex completes his work, he might not know what to do with it or whom to give it to. However, the phrasing is awkward and makes it difficult to understand the intended meaning. Common sense statements are typically clear, concise, and easily understood, which is not the case with this statement. Therefore, it does not align with the characteristics of common sense.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1142, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex performs alex's work might think of which to hand it.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex performs Alex's work might think of which to hand it\" is unclear and somewhat confusing. The sentence structure is fragmented, and it lacks proper context or clarity regarding what is meant by \"hand it.\" Without a clear understanding of the intended meaning or context, it is difficult to determine whether this statement represents common sense. Additionally, the grammatical errors make it challenging to interpret the statement accurately.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1143, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex performs alex's work then they would complete the work satisfactorily.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex performs Alex's work then they would complete the work satisfactorily\" implies that Alex is capable and competent in handling their own responsibilities. It assumes that Alex has the necessary skills, knowledge, and motivation to execute the tasks assigned to them effectively. In a general context, this is a reasonable expectation when someone is assigned a task or responsibility that aligns with their abilities or job description. Therefore, it is common sense to expect satisfactory completion of work when an individual performs tasks they are expected or designated to do. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1144, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex performs alex's work then they would make obvious mistakes.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that if Alex performs their work, they would make obvious mistakes, which implies that Alex is inherently prone to errors in their work. This is not a fair or common sense assumption, as it generalizes Alex's capability and does not consider factors such as the nature of the work, Alex's level of experience, or external circumstances that could affect performance. It is unreasonable to assume that someone would always make obvious mistakes simply by engaging in their work.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1145, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex performs alex's work they would do it incorrectly.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex performs Alex's work they would do it incorrectly\" is not necessarily common sense, as it makes an assumption about Alex's capability without any context or evidence. Common sense would suggest that if Alex is skilled and knowledgeable in the task at hand, they should be able to perform their work correctly. The statement lacks information about Alex's qualifications, experience, or the specific nature of the work. Making a blanket statement about someone's performance without such details is not grounded in common sense. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 1146, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex performs sam analysis they would forget to to make sure sam had everything they needed to take the test accurately.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that Alex, while performing an analysis on Sam, would forget to ensure that Sam had all the necessary resources to complete a test accurately. This seems to imply a lack of thoroughness or attention to detail on Alex's part. However, whether this is common sense depends on the context and the individuals involved. Without specific information about Alex's usual behavior or competency, it's not reasonable to assume they would forget to provide necessary resources as a matter of common sense. Common sense would typically dictate that anyone performing an analysis would ensure all prerequisites for accuracy are met. \n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1147, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex performs sam analysis they would make sure sam has all the tools they need and no distractions so they can be analyzed.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement seems to suggest that when conducting an analysis, it is important to ensure that the subject or individual being analyzed, in this case Sam, has all the necessary resources and a conducive environment free from distractions. This is a logical approach as it would facilitate accurate and effective analysis by minimizing external variables that could affect the outcome. Ensuring that the individual has the necessary tools allows them to perform to the best of their ability, while minimizing distractions helps maintain focus and the integrity of the analysis. Therefore, the statement reflects a common-sense approach to conducting an analysis effectively. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1148, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex plays rugby he's gonna get hit.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex plays rugby he's gonna get hit\" is based on the nature of the sport. Rugby is a contact sport where physical tackles and collisions are fundamental aspects of the game. Players, including Alex, can reasonably expect physical contact and getting hit during play. Therefore, the statement aligns with the common characteristics of the sport.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1149, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex plays rugby he's got to be quick.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex plays rugby he's got to be quick\" is based on the idea that speed is an important attribute for success in the sport of rugby. Rugby is a fast-paced game that requires agility and quick reflexes to evade opponents, make tackles, and score tries. Therefore, it is reasonable to expect that someone who plays rugby would need to possess a certain level of quickness to effectively participate and compete in the sport.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1150, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex pounds sand alex eats sand.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex pounds sand, Alex eats sand\" is not common sense. Common sense would suggest that pounding sand, which generally means to perform a futile or pointless task, does not have a direct correlation with consuming sand. Eating sand is not a typical or logical consequence of pounding sand, as the two actions are unrelated in a practical sense.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1151, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex pounds sand found this helpful.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If alex pounds sand found this helpful\" is incomplete and lacks context, making it difficult to evaluate its common sense. It does not provide enough information about who Alex is, what action he is taking, or why pounding sand would be helpful. Without a clear understanding of these elements, it is challenging to determine if the statement aligns with common sense.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1152, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex pounds sand into the toilet bowl and breaks it.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement describes an action that would likely lead to damage of the toilet bowl, as pounding sand into it could cause clogs, scratches, or structural damage. Common sense suggests that treating bathroom fixtures with care is necessary to maintain their functionality and prevent costly repairs. Therefore, the action described is not aligned with common sense. \n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1153, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex pounds sand they would expect the sand to quickly turn to glass.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The process of turning sand into glass involves heating sand to extremely high temperatures, usually around 1700 degrees Celsius, in order to melt it into a liquid form that can then be molded and cooled into glass. Simply pounding sand with physical force, as the statement suggests, would not generate the heat or conditions necessary to turn sand into glass. Therefore, expecting sand to turn into glass just by pounding it is not based on a common understanding of the glass-making process.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1154, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex prevents sam attack alex is invincible.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex prevents Sam from attacking, Alex is invincible\" does not necessarily align with common sense. Being able to prevent an attack from one individual does not imply that Alex is invincible, as invincibility suggests an inability to be defeated or harmed in any way by anyone or anything. Preventing a single attack from one person only indicates a specific, limited capability, not universal invincibility. Therefore, the logic of the statement is flawed.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1155, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex pulls sam away sam don't ask help from morgan.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex pulls Sam away, Sam doesn't ask for help from Morgan\" is not necessarily common sense. It depends on the context and relationship between the individuals involved. If Sam feels threatened or uncomfortable, he may still seek help from Morgan or someone else. Alternatively, if the action is part of a playful or consensual interaction, Sam might not feel the need to ask for help. Without additional information about the situation and the dynamics between the individuals, it's difficult to determine if the statement aligns with common sense. \n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1156, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex punches sam's lights out he will call an ambulance.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that if Alex punches Sam severely enough to knock him unconscious or cause serious injury (\"punches his lights out\"), then he will call an ambulance. This implies a recognition of the seriousness of the injury and a sense of responsibility to seek medical help for Sam. It is common sense to call for medical assistance in the case of a severe injury to ensure the well-being and safety of the injured individual. Therefore, the idea that Alex would call an ambulance after inflicting such harm aligns with a basic understanding of emergency response and accountability in a critical situation.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1157, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex punches sam's lights out he will punch sam again.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that if Alex punches Sam's lights out, he will continue to be aggressive by punching Sam again. This is not necessarily common sense, as it assumes Alex's behavior will escalate or continue, which may not be the case. People's actions can vary widely depending on the situation and their emotional state. Without more context about the circumstances and motivations, it's not possible to determine if this statement reflects common sense. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 1158, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex pushes sam aside alex does not acknowledge the rude behavior.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that if Alex pushes Sam aside, he does not recognize or admit that his behavior was rude. This can be seen as common sense because it reflects a common human tendency to overlook or deny one's own negative actions, especially in situations where acknowledging them could lead to social disapproval or confrontation. People often rationalize their behavior or remain unaware of the impact of their actions on others. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1159, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex pushes sam aside alex walks away without apologizing.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement describes a scenario where Alex pushes Sam aside and then walks away without apologizing. Whether this is common sense or not depends on the context and the social norms or expectations in place. In many cultures, it is expected that if someone pushes another person, an apology should be offered to acknowledge the wrongdoing and show respect. Therefore, the behavior described in the statement does not align with common social expectations of politeness and accountability. \n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1160, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex puts sam's arms around sam then morgan would assume that alex is playing a prank on sam.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement requires understanding the context and relationships between the individuals involved. If Alex is known for playing pranks and Morgan is aware of this behavior, then it would be reasonable for Morgan to assume that Alex is playing a prank on Sam by manipulating Sam's arms. However, without additional context about the personalities and relationship dynamics, it's difficult to determine whether this is a common sense assumption for Morgan to make. Common sense often relies on general knowledge and typical social cues, but the specific scenario described may not be universally understood or interpreted in the same way by everyone.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1161, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex puts sam's arms around sam to fight.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex puts Sam's arms around Sam to fight\" does not make common sense as it is not clear how Alex using Sam's own arms to fight would be practical or effective. It suggests an illogical scenario where Alex manipulates someone else's limbs for a fight, which is not a typical or sensible way to engage in a physical altercation. Additionally, it raises questions about autonomy and control in the situation described. \n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1162, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex raises alex's arm then morgan would attack alex immediately.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex raises Alex's arm then Morgan would attack Alex immediately\" is not necessarily common sense, as it lacks context or a logical connection between the action and the reaction. Common sense would dictate that actions and reactions are generally related in a reasonable or understandable way. Without further information on the relationship between Alex and Morgan, any previous interactions, or reasons for Morgan to attack, it is not reasonable to assume that simply raising an arm would provoke an immediate attack. Therefore, the statement does not align with common sense expectations of cause and effect.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1163, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex reaches alex's climax then that is the end of that.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex reaches Alex's climax then that is the end of that\" suggests that reaching a climax marks a conclusion or resolution of a situation or event. In many contexts, the term \"climax\" refers to the peak or turning point, after which there is a resolution or conclusion. Therefore, it is logical to infer that once the climax is reached, the event or situation comes to an end.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1164, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex redoes alex's bedroom they will pick colors that don't blend well and buy foolish things for decorations.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement is not necessarily common sense as it makes assumptions about Alex's taste and decision-making without any specific evidence or context. Personal preferences in colors and decorations vary greatly among individuals, and what one person may consider foolish, another may find appealing or artistic. The statement is subjective and based on opinion rather than a universally accepted truth or logical reasoning.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1165, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex refuses to pay others must chip in.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex refuses to pay others must chip in\" implies a shared responsibility or agreement among a group to cover costs, even if one member does not contribute. This could be a common understanding in situations where group activities or expenses are involved and everyone is expected to contribute to the total cost. If one person doesn't pay their share, the rest of the group might have to cover the shortfall to ensure that the activity or expense is still manageable. However, whether this is considered common sense can depend on the specific context and the agreements made within the group. If there is a clear agreement that everyone is responsible for an equal share, then it would be reasonable for others to chip in if one person does not pay. On the other hand, if there is no such agreement, expecting others to cover for someone who refuses to pay might not be seen as common sense.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1166, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex rents sam apartment he will leave the windows open and rain will get in the apartment and ruin the floor.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement makes an assumption that Alex will leave the windows open, and that rain will get in and ruin the floor as a result. This assumption may not be valid as Alex could choose to close the windows or there may not be rain. The statement also lacks context about whether Alex has a history of leaving windows open or if the location is prone to rain. Therefore, it is not necessarily common sense to assume that renting the apartment to Alex will definitely result in the floor being ruined. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 1167, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex rents sam apartment he will shut the windows when it's raining so water does not ruin the floor.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement reflects a logical and practical action to prevent water damage to the apartment's interior, which is a typical concern for renters and property owners alike. Closing windows during rain is a common and sensible measure to protect the property and maintain its condition. Therefore, the statement aligns with general expectations and prudent behavior in such a situation.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1168, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex rents sam apartment they would have to replace most of the fixtures and floors.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex rents Sam's apartment they would have to replace most of the fixtures and floors\" suggests that the apartment is in poor condition and requires significant repairs or updates. This could be common sense if there is prior knowledge or evidence that the apartment is indeed outdated or damaged. However, without additional context about the state of the apartment, it's difficult to determine whether this statement is based on common sense or an assumption. Therefore, it's not necessarily a common-sense statement as it relies on specific conditions that are not provided in the statement itself.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1169, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex returns the car he or might accept the car.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex returns the car he or might accept the car\" seems logically inconsistent and unclear. It suggests that Alex returning the car is a condition for possibly accepting the car, which doesn't make sense as accepting the car would typically precede or coincide with taking possession of it, not follow returning it. The phrasing and structure of the statement are also confusing, making it difficult to determine what is actually meant.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1170, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex rides tall in the saddle alex is wise to bring others up as well.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that when someone, like Alex, is successful or in a position of power (\"rides tall in the saddle\"), it is wise for them to help elevate others as well. This idea aligns with principles of leadership, mentorship, and social responsibility. Helping others succeed can contribute to a more positive and productive environment for everyone involved. It can also enhance the leader's reputation and effectiveness.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1171, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex rides tall in the saddle he she is weak to belittle others.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex rides tall in the saddle, he/she is weak to belittle others\" suggests that someone who appears confident and dominant (riding tall in the saddle) actually has an underlying weakness that leads them to put others down. This idea relies on the assumption that outward displays of confidence may mask insecurities, and that belittling others can be a way for insecure individuals to assert dominance or elevate their own self-esteem. While it is not universally true that all confident individuals belittle others out of weakness, it is a plausible psychological observation that some might do so as a coping mechanism for their own insecurities. Therefore, the statement could be seen as an expression of common sense in certain contexts where this behavior is observed. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1172, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex rides tall in the saddle then they will avoid any objects in their path that might hit the upper portion of their body.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that riding tall in the saddle will help Alex avoid objects that could hit their upper body. However, riding tall in the saddle generally means sitting upright and maintaining good posture, which may not necessarily affect one's ability to avoid overhead obstacles. The ability to avoid such objects would depend more on the rider's awareness and ability to maneuver rather than their posture in the saddle. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 1173, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex rides tall in the saddle then they would ride into a low limb and hit themselves in the head.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement implies that riding tall in the saddle would make Alex more vulnerable to hitting their head on a low-hanging limb. This assumes that sitting taller makes one's head closer to obstacles like tree branches, which logically makes sense. However, the likelihood of actually hitting a low limb depends on other factors such as the height of the branch, the height of the saddle, and the terrain. The statement uses a hypothetical scenario to suggest caution while riding, which aligns with common sense advice to be aware of one's surroundings to avoid accidents. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1174, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex runs around like a chicken with its head cut off.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex runs around like a chicken with its head cut off\" is a metaphorical expression that implies chaotic or frenzied behavior, similar to how a chicken might behave after its head has been cut off. It suggests a lack of control or purpose in Alex's actions. The statement itself is a common idiomatic expression in English used to convey a sense of disorder or panic. However, whether it is common sense depends on the context in which it is used. If the statement is used to describe someone acting in a chaotic manner in a situation that would warrant a more composed response, then it aligns with common sense as it effectively communicates the nature of the behavior. On the other hand, if used literally, it would not be common sense, as humans do not physically behave like headless chickens. Therefore, the interpretation of common sense relies on understanding it as a metaphor.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1175, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex runs as fast as sam could alex would still lose the race.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement implies that even if Alex matches Sam's speed, Alex would still lose the race. This suggests there may be other factors at play, such as the starting position, endurance, or the length of the race, which could disadvantage Alex. Without knowing those additional details, the statement on its own seems to assume that Sam has an inherent advantage beyond just speed. Therefore, the statement is not necessarily common sense as it lacks sufficient context. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 1176, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex runs as fast as sam could then alex could never beat sam in a race.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that if Alex runs at the same maximum speed as Sam, then the two would be equally matched in a race. If they both run at their fastest possible speed and that speed is the same, it follows logically that Alex could not overtake or \"beat\" Sam, as they would be running at an equal pace. Other factors like stamina, strategy, and race conditions could play a role, but based solely on speed, Alex could not surpass Sam if their speeds are identical.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1177, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex runs as fast as sam could then they will have achieved the one and only goal they have in life.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement does not necessarily align with common sense, as it makes a broad generalization about the life goals of Alex and Sam based solely on their running speed. It is unlikely that their sole life goal is tied to running speed alone, as individuals typically have diverse and multifaceted goals in life that encompass various aspects beyond physical abilities. Additionally, the statement does not consider other potential goals or ambitions they may have, nor does it account for other factors that contribute to life satisfaction and fulfillment. \n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1178, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex says something like that no one will care.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex says something like that no one will care\" is not necessarily common sense, as it is subjective and depends on the context. Common sense generally refers to widely held beliefs or practical reasoning that are considered obvious and self-evident. The impact of Alex's statement would depend on various factors such as the relevance, the audience's perception of Alex, and the content of what is being said. Without knowing the specifics, it's difficult to determine whether the statement aligns with common sense. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 1179, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex says something like that when they are jumping over a cliff.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex says something like that when they are jumping over a cliff\" is not a complete or coherent thought, making it difficult to assess as a common sense statement. Additionally, the context of jumping over a cliff and speaking simultaneously seems unusual and potentially dangerous. Common sense would suggest focusing on safety rather than speaking in such a risky situation. Therefore, the statement does not align with common sense.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1180, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex scratches the ticket he use his hand.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex scratches the ticket he uses his hand\" is generally considered common sense because scratching is an action typically performed using hands or fingers. It is a natural and instinctive way for humans to interact with objects that require manipulation, such as scratching a ticket to reveal information underneath. Using hands for scratching is a common and expected behavior.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1181, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex scratches the ticket they check to see if they won any money.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex scratches the ticket, they check to see if they won any money\" indicates a natural sequence of actions that a person would typically follow when engaging with a scratch-off lottery ticket. The primary purpose of purchasing a scratch ticket is to potentially win a prize, which is revealed by scratching off the covering on the ticket. Once the ticket is scratched, it is common sense to then check if the revealed information indicates a win. Therefore, the statement aligns with the typical behavior and expectations associated with scratch-off lottery tickets. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1182, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex sees a bat he will poke the bat.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex sees a bat he will poke the bat\" does not necessarily align with common sense, as poking a bat could be dangerous or harmful to both Alex and the bat. Bats are wild animals and may carry diseases, and disturbing them could provoke aggressive behavior. Additionally, it is generally advised to observe wildlife from a safe distance and avoid direct interaction. Therefore, it is not common sense to assume that someone would intentionally poke a bat upon seeing it.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1183, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex sees a bat he will take a picture.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex sees a bat he will take a picture\" is not necessarily common sense, as it is dependent on Alex's specific behavior or interest in bats. Common sense typically refers to general knowledge or beliefs that are widely held and considered reasonable by most people. In this case, not everyone who sees a bat would necessarily take a picture, as it depends on individual preferences, interests, and circumstances. Therefore, this statement is not a universally applicable or obvious conclusion based solely on common sense. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 1184, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex sees a sign they would do opposite of what the sign says.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex sees a sign they would do the opposite of what the sign says\" suggests a deliberate non-compliance or a tendency to disregard instructions. This behavior is not typical or expected in most contexts, as signs are usually intended to guide or inform behavior for safety, order, or efficiency. Common sense would generally dictate following signs to ensure personal and public well-being, rather than purposefully doing the opposite. Therefore, this statement does not align with what would be considered common sense behavior.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1185, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex sees a sign they would do what the sign says.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex sees a sign they would do what the sign says\" assumes that Alex always follows the instructions on signs without question. However, in reality, people may choose to follow or ignore signs based on various factors such as the situation, personal judgment, or the perceived legitimacy of the sign. Therefore, it is not necessarily common sense to assume that someone would always do what a sign says just because they see it. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 1186, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex sells things on ebay alex would get scammed.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex sells things on eBay, Alex would get scammed\" is not necessarily common sense, as it assumes a guaranteed negative outcome without considering variables such as the precautions taken by the seller, the nature of the items being sold, and the reliability of the buyers. eBay also has various protective measures in place to prevent scams and support sellers. Therefore, selling on eBay does not automatically lead to being scammed.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1187, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex sells things on ebay i do not know what ebay is.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex sells things on eBay, I do not know what eBay is\" does not necessarily follow common sense. The fact that Alex sells things on eBay does not inherently determine or influence another person's knowledge or awareness of what eBay is. This statement suggests a cause-and-effect relationship where none logically exists. Therefore, the statement does not align with common sense reasoning. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 1188, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex sells things on ebay they will be broke.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex sells things on eBay they will be broke\" does not necessarily align with common sense, as selling items on eBay could potentially generate income for Alex, rather than causing them to be broke. It is important to consider the context, such as what Alex is selling, at what price, and their overall financial situation, to determine whether selling on eBay would lead to financial hardship. Without further information, the statement lacks sufficient evidence to be considered common sense.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1189, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex sends sam to the showers morgan will sarcastically laugh at sam.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex sends Sam to the showers, Morgan will sarcastically laugh at Sam\" does not necessarily reflect common sense as it relies on specific knowledge about the relationships and personalities of the individuals involved. Common sense typically refers to basic, practical judgment that is universally shared. The statement assumes particular behaviors and interactions that are not universally predictable or applicable. It requires specific context about Alex, Sam, and Morgan's dynamics, which is not universally understood or agreed upon. Therefore, it is not a common sense statement as it does not involve universally known principles or reasoning.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1190, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex sends sam to the showers they would laugh that they will be naked.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement does not necessarily reflect common sense as it makes an assumption about a specific reaction (laughter) to a specific situation (being sent to the showers) without any clear context or reasoning behind why that reaction would occur. People may have different reactions to being sent to the showers and being naked, and laughter is not a guaranteed or typical response. Additionally, the statement lacks clarity and specifics about the situation, making it difficult to assess as a common sense statement.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1191, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex sends sam to the showers yeah.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex sends Sam to the showers yeah\" is unclear and lacks context, making it difficult to determine if it represents common sense. It is not a complete sentence and does not provide enough information about the situation or the relationship between Alex and Sam. Additionally, the phrase \"yeah\" at the end is informal and does not clarify the intent or consequence of the action. Based on the ambiguity and lack of context, it is hard to say that this statement represents common sense. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 1192, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex shares alex's knowledge alex wouldn't give credit.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that if Alex shares his knowledge, he would not give credit to the sources or individuals from whom he acquired the knowledge. This implies a lack of acknowledgment or appreciation for others' contributions, which could be considered unethical or unprofessional. Generally, it is expected that individuals give credit to the appropriate sources when sharing knowledge that is not originally their own. Therefore, the statement does not align with common practices of giving credit where it is due.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1193, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex shares alex's knowledge the knowledge would not be correct.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that any knowledge shared by Alex would be incorrect, which is a broad generalization and not necessarily true. Knowledge shared by an individual can be accurate or inaccurate depending on their level of expertise and the accuracy of the information they possess. Without specific context about the reliability of Alex's knowledge or expertise in a particular field, it is unreasonable to assume that all knowledge shared by Alex would be incorrect. Therefore, the statement does not align with common sense as it lacks nuance and unjustifiably discredits the individual's ability to share correct knowledge.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1194, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex shows sam respect alex would put themselves down.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex shows Sam respect, Alex would put themselves down\" implies that showing respect involves self-deprecation or diminishing oneself, which is not a common or healthy understanding of respect. Respect is generally about acknowledging and valuing others' qualities or rights without necessarily lowering one's own status or self-worth. Therefore, the idea that showing respect requires putting oneself down is not aligned with the general concept of respect.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1195, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex shows sam respect sam don't care about it.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that Sam is indifferent to whether or not Alex shows him respect. Common sense would dictate that most people generally appreciate and care about being shown respect, as it is a fundamental aspect of positive social interactions and relationships. Therefore, the statement contradicts common sense expectations of human behavior in social settings. \n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1196, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex shows sam respect sam will be disrespectful back.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex shows Sam respect, Sam will be disrespectful back\" does not align with common sense, as typically showing respect to someone would not lead to them being disrespectful in return. Respect is generally reciprocated with respect, and most social norms and interpersonal dynamics support the idea of mutual respect. If Sam consistently responds to respect with disrespect, it would be considered unusual or contrary to common expectations. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 1197, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex slips on a banana peel then morgan would laugh at alex's fall.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex slips on a banana peel then Morgan would laugh at Alex's fall\" suggests a cause-and-effect relationship wherein Morgan's reaction (laughter) is triggered by Alex's misfortune (slipping on a banana peel). This type of reaction could be considered common if Morgan finds physical comedy or slapstick humor amusing. However, it's important to note that not everyone may find humor in someone else's accident due to concerns of empathy, social appropriateness, or personal values. Without further context about Morgan's personality or the relationship between Morgan and Alex, it's difficult to definitively say that this reaction is universally common sense.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1198, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex speaks with a forked tongue many people will praise him.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex speaks with a forked tongue many people will praise him\" suggests that if Alex is deceitful or dishonest in his speech, he will receive praise from many people. This does not align with common sense, as generally, honesty and integrity are valued traits, and deceitfulness is typically frowned upon in society. Therefore, it is not common sense to expect that dishonest behavior would result in widespread praise.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1199, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex speaks with a forked tongue morgan will foolishly get into an argument with alex.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that if Alex is dishonest or deceitful (speaking with a forked tongue), Morgan will react by engaging in an argument with Alex. This could be seen as common sense if one assumes that deceitful or dishonest behavior often provokes arguments or conflicts. People generally do not respond well to dishonesty, and it can lead to emotional or defensive reactions, such as starting an argument. However, whether this is always the case can depend on the individuals involved and the specific circumstances. Nevertheless, the general idea that dishonesty can lead to arguments is a reasonable assumption. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1200, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex speaks with a forked tongue they would say exactly what they mean.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex speaks with a forked tongue they would say exactly what they mean\" contradicts common understanding of the phrase \"speaks with a forked tongue.\" Typically, this idiom implies deceit or speaking in a duplicitous manner, meaning the speaker says one thing but intends another. Therefore, if Alex speaks with a forked tongue, it would imply that they are not saying exactly what they mean, but rather being misleading or dishonest. Thus, the statement presented does not align with the common interpretation of the idiom.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1201, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex spends most of sam's time sam will be frustrated.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that if Alex occupies most of Sam's time, it will lead to Sam feeling frustrated. This reasoning aligns with common understanding that individuals need personal time and space to maintain their well-being and manage their own responsibilities. If Alex is taking up most of Sam's time, it could interfere with Sam's ability to fulfill personal obligations or enjoy leisure activities, which can naturally lead to frustration. Therefore, the statement is based on a logical understanding of personal boundaries and the consequences of overstepping them.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1202, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex spends most of sam's time they will enjoy their time.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex spends most of Sam's time they will enjoy their time\" is somewhat ambiguous and lacks clarity in terms of what it means for one person to spend another person's time. It is also not clear how spending someone else's time directly correlates with enjoyment. Enjoyment is subjective and depends on the activities and preferences of both individuals involved. Therefore, it is difficult to determine whether this statement is common sense without further context or clarification.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1203, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex spends weeks they will give up.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex spends weeks they will give up\" is vague and lacks context, making it difficult to determine if it represents common sense. It is not clear what Alex is spending weeks on, what \"give up\" entails, or what the circumstances or motivations are. Without additional information, it is not possible to assess whether this is a logical or reasonable conclusion. Therefore, it is not possible to determine if it is common sense based on the information provided.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1204, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex spreads sam's legs he might apologize if the other person feels uncomfortable.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement described involves an inappropriate action and a response that is contingent on the feelings of another person. Common sense suggests that actions that could make others feel uncomfortable, especially those of a physical nature, should be avoided entirely and not just apologized for conditionally. Additionally, consent and respect for personal boundaries are fundamental aspects that should be prioritized in any interaction. Therefore, the statement lacks common sense because it assumes an apology might be necessary only if discomfort is expressed, rather than promoting mutual respect and consent from the beginning.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1205, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex starts alex's new job he will be unfriendly to his new boss.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex starts his new job he will be unfriendly to his new boss\" is not necessarily common sense. Common sense would suggest that a person would generally strive to be friendly and make a good impression when starting a new job, in order to establish positive relationships and succeed in their role. The statement assumes a negative behavior without context or reason, which goes against typical expectations in a professional setting. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 1206, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex starts alex's new job he will try to get along with this coworkers.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex starts Alex's new job he will try to get along with his coworkers\" is based on the general assumption that most people aim to maintain positive relationships in the workplace to foster a collaborative and supportive work environment. Building good relationships with coworkers can lead to better teamwork, job satisfaction, and overall productivity. Therefore, it is common for individuals to make an effort to get along with their colleagues when starting a new job.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1207, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex starts alex's new job they will earn a living.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex starts Alex's new job they will earn a living\" is based on the general understanding that starting a job leads to earning income, which is necessary for supporting oneself financially. In most cases, employment provides the means to earn a living, making the statement a reflection of common sense. Therefore, the logic that starting a job results in earning a living holds true under typical circumstances. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1208, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex starts alex's new job they will insult the manager.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex starts Alex's new job they will insult the manager\" is not necessarily common sense. Common sense would suggest that when starting a new job, an individual would want to make a good impression and maintain professionalism, and insulting the manager would be counterproductive to that goal. The statement assumes a specific behavior from Alex without any context or reasoning as to why they would insult the manager, making it an unreasonable generalization.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1209, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex starts alex's new job they would do what was expected of them from that job.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that if Alex begins a new job, they would fulfill the responsibilities and duties associated with that role. This is a reasonable expectation as most individuals who start a new job aim to meet the requirements and perform their tasks effectively to maintain their employment and potentially advance in their career. It is generally assumed that employees will strive to meet the expectations set by their employers. \n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1210, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex starts alex's new job they wouldn't do the things that were expected of that job.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that Alex would not fulfill the responsibilities associated with the new job, which is not a typical or common expectation when starting a new job. Generally, when someone starts a new job, it is assumed they will attempt to meet the job's expectations and responsibilities. The statement contradicts the general understanding of employment commitments. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 1211, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex starts exercising he will forget to eat and his blood sugar will get low.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex starts exercising he will forget to eat and his blood sugar will get low\" is not necessarily common sense as it makes assumptions without considering individual factors. It assumes that exercising will cause Alex to forget to eat, which may not be true for everyone. Additionally, the effect of exercise on blood sugar can vary depending on the person's health, the type of exercise, and whether they have eaten beforehand. The statement oversimplifies the relationship between exercise, eating, and blood sugar levels. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 1212, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex starts exercising he will make sure to eat protein first so his blood sugar doesn't get low.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement, \"If Alex starts exercising he will make sure to eat protein first so his blood sugar doesn't get low,\" may not align with typical nutritional advice for managing blood sugar during exercise. Commonly, it is recommended to have a balanced meal or snack that includes carbohydrates before exercise, as carbohydrates are the primary source of energy and can help maintain blood sugar levels. Protein is also important, but it is not the primary nutrient that prevents low blood sugar during physical activity. Therefore, the statement may not reflect common sense based on general nutritional guidelines for exercise.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1213, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex starts exercising they will attain higher physical fitness.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex starts exercising they will attain higher physical fitness\" is generally considered common sense because exercise is widely known to improve physical fitness. Engaging in regular physical activity increases cardiovascular endurance, muscle strength, flexibility, and overall health. Exercise stimulates various physiological responses in the body that contribute to improved fitness levels. Therefore, if Alex starts an appropriate exercise regimen, it is reasonable to expect an improvement in their physical fitness.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1214, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex starts exercising they will gain weight.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex starts exercising, they will gain weight\" does not align with common sense because typically, when people exercise, they burn calories and lose fat, which often leads to weight loss or maintaining a healthy weight. However, it's possible for someone to gain weight if they build muscle mass through strength training exercises or if their increased appetite from exercise leads to a higher calorie intake. But generally, exercise is associated with weight management or weight loss, not automatically gaining weight.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1215, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex starts exercising they will hurt themself.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex starts exercising they will hurt themself\" is not necessarily common sense. Exercise, when done properly and with appropriate precautions, can be beneficial and safe for most people. The statement assumes that injury is inevitable, which is not true if Alex warms up, uses proper form, and listens to their body. Additionally, the statement does not consider individual factors such as Alex's current fitness level, the type of exercise, or any pre-existing conditions that might affect their risk of injury. Therefore, the statement is an overgeneralization. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 1216, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex starts exercising they will lose weight.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex starts exercising, they will lose weight\" is generally considered to be common sense because exercise is widely recognized as a method of burning calories and increasing metabolism, which can lead to weight loss. However, weight loss also depends on other factors such as diet, genetics, and overall lifestyle. Although exercise can contribute to weight loss, it is not guaranteed for everyone as individual results can vary. Despite these nuances, the basic idea that exercise can help with weight loss is commonly accepted. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1217, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex starts exercising they will make sure their shoes are tied first.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex starts exercising they will make sure their shoes are tied first\" is based on the common sense notion that having shoes properly tied is important for safety and effectiveness while exercising. Tying shoes helps prevent tripping and falling, which could lead to injury. It is a basic precaution that most people would take before engaging in physical activity. Therefore, it appears to be a practical and reasonable assumption.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1218, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex stays home today he will spend the day relaxing.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex stays home today he will spend the day relaxing\" is based on an assumption about how Alex chooses to spend his time at home. It implies that staying home is associated with relaxation, which can be a common perspective. However, without additional context about Alex's preferences, responsibilities, or obligations at home, it's not possible to definitively say that he will relax just because he is at home. Therefore, the statement is not necessarily common sense as it relies on an assumption that may not be universally true. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 1219, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex stops in front of sam it is because they are a time traveler looking to prevent sam's death.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement provided is not an example of common sense, as it relies on the speculative and fictional concept of time travel. Common sense typically refers to practical and sound judgment based on simple perceptions and everyday experiences. The idea that someone would be a time traveler intervening to prevent someone's death is an extraordinary and fantastical scenario, which does not align with ordinary reasoning or widely accepted knowledge. \n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1220, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex stops in front of sam it is possible that sam could run into alex from behind.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement is based on a logical sequence of events where one person stopping suddenly in front of another could lead to a collision if the following person does not have enough time to react. In scenarios involving movement, such as walking, running, or driving, it is a common understanding that abruptly stopping can result in the person behind running into the one in front. Therefore, the statement aligns with general understanding of motion and reaction time.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1221, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex stretches sam legs they would loosen up large muscle groups.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that stretching can help loosen up large muscle groups, which is a commonly accepted idea in fitness and physical therapy. Stretching helps increase flexibility and range of motion, and can also help alleviate muscle tightness and prevent injury. Therefore, the idea that stretching Sam's legs could help loosen up his large muscle groups aligns with general understanding of the benefits of stretching. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1222, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex stretches sam legs they would pull a muscle by stretching too far.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement implies that stretching someone's legs too far could lead to pulling a muscle, which is generally true as overstretching can cause muscle strains or injuries. With adequate context, assuming that \"alex\" is not a trained professional and might not know the limits of safe stretching, it is reasonable to say that excessive stretching could result in harm. Therefore, the statement aligns with common sense in terms of general knowledge about the potential risks of overstretching.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1223, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex surprises sam with tickets then the second person would be happy and excited about the date.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement is based on the assumption that receiving a surprise gift, such as tickets, would naturally make someone happy and excited, especially if it involves spending time together on a date. This is a common expectation as surprises generally elicit positive emotions and a date indicates a shared enjoyable experience. However, the reaction can also depend on the individual's preferences, their relationship with the person giving the gift, and the nature of the event they are being taken to. Despite these variables, it is generally reasonable to expect a positive reaction to such a surprise. \n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1224, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex surprises sam with tickets then the second person would notice that the tickets are to separate shows.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement does not align with common sense because typically when someone surprises another person with tickets, the intention is for both individuals to attend the same event together and enjoy the experience as a shared activity. The idea that the tickets would be for separate shows contradicts the usual purpose of giving tickets as a surprise in a social context. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 1225, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex surprises sam with tickets they will expect sam to be excited.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex surprises Sam with tickets they will expect Sam to be excited\" is based on the assumption that surprises, especially in the form of tickets to an event or activity, are generally perceived as positive gestures. When someone receives a gift or a surprise, it is common for the giver to expect a positive reaction such as excitement or happiness. This expectation is rooted in social norms and the typical human response to receiving something enjoyable or desirable. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that if Alex surprises Sam with tickets, Alex will expect Sam to be excited due to the positive nature of the surprise.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1226, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex swings the bat they are playing football.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex swings the bat they are playing football\" does not align with common sense because swinging a bat is typically associated with sports such as baseball or cricket, not football. In football, the primary actions involve kicking, throwing, and carrying a ball, rather than using a bat. Therefore, the statement presents a scenario that contradicts the general understanding of the equipment used in football. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 1227, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex swings the bat they have not checked if it is safe to take a swing.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that Alex swings the bat without verifying safety first, which may not necessarily be true in all cases. It is possible for Alex to have checked the safety before swinging the bat. The statement assumes a lack of precaution without any evidence or context to support the claim. Therefore, it is not common sense to assume that swinging the bat equates to not checking safety. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 1228, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex swings the bat they swing when others are close by.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that Alex swings the bat only when others are nearby, which may not necessarily be common sense. The behavior of swinging a bat could depend on various factors such as the context, purpose, and environment. For instance, if Alex is playing baseball in a game or practice, swinging the bat when others are close by might be expected. However, if Alex is swinging a bat in a potentially harmful or inappropriate situation, it might not be considered common sense. Therefore, without additional context about the situation, it's difficult to definitively label this statement as common sense. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 1229, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex takes a breather it is necessary to regroup.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex takes a breather it is necessary to regroup\" suggests that when Alex takes a break, it is essential for the team or group to reassess and realign their efforts. This could imply that Alex plays a critical role in the group's function and dynamics. However, whether this statement is common sense depends on the context and the specific circumstances of the situation. Without additional information about Alex's role, the group's dependency on Alex, and the nature of the task or project, it is difficult to definitively say that this statement is common sense.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1230, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex takes a breather it'll become a snoozer.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex takes a breather, it'll become a snoozer,\" appears to be metaphorical or idiomatic. It suggests that if Alex, presumably a key figure in a situation or event, pauses or steps away, the situation may become dull or less engaging. The assumption is that Alex's participation or presence is crucial for maintaining interest or excitement. Without further context to clarify the roles and circumstances, it's not possible to definitively say this is common sense, as it relies on specific assumptions about Alex's role and the context. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 1231, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex takes a breather might think of which to hand it.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex takes a breather might think of which to hand it\" is not clear and lacks proper grammar and context. It is difficult to understand the meaning or intention behind the statement without additional information about what \"it\" refers to, or what the context of the situation is. The statement seems incomplete and does not follow a logical structure that would be considered common sense.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1232, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex takes a breather the other might not.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex takes a breather the other might not\" suggests that there is a possibility that someone else may choose not to take a breather if Alex does. This could be interpreted in various ways depending on the context. If it's referring to a group activity where taking turns is required, it might be common sense that when one person takes a break, others continue the activity. However, without specific context, the statement is too vague to be definitively considered common sense, as it relies on the assumption of an unstated relationship or agreement between Alex and the other person.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1233, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex takes a breather they will be well rested.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex takes a breather they will be well rested\" is based on the idea that taking breaks or resting can help rejuvenate a person's energy and mental alertness. This is a commonly understood concept as rest is essential for physical and mental recovery. Scientific research supports the idea that taking breaks can improve performance and overall well-being. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that if Alex takes a breather, they are likely to be better rested.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1234, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex takes a breather they will run to work.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex takes a breather they will run to work\" seems illogical and counterintuitive. Generally, taking a breather implies resting or pausing, which contrasts with the action of running. Running to work after taking a breather does not follow the typical understanding of the phrase and doesn't align with common sense expectations of behavior after resting. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 1235, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex takes advantage of sam it is because they love and respect them.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex takes advantage of Sam it is because they love and respect them\" suggests that exploiting someone is a sign of love and respect, which contradicts the typical understanding of these emotions. Love and respect generally involve caring for and valuing someone's well-being, not taking advantage of them. Exploitative behavior is more commonly associated with selfishness and a lack of regard for the other person's feelings and rights. Therefore, the statement does not align with the common understanding of love and respect. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 1236, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex takes advantage of sam morgan will side with alex in undermining sam.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex takes advantage of Sam, Morgan will side with Alex in undermining Sam\" is not necessarily common sense. Common sense would suggest that individuals make their own decisions based on personal values, beliefs, and relationships, rather than automatically siding with one person against another. The statement assumes that Morgan would automatically side with Alex without considering other factors such as their relationship with Sam, their own sense of morality, or the specific circumstances of the situation. Therefore, it is not a universally applicable or predictable outcome based solely on common sense.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1237, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex takes advantage of sam then sam will feel happy.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex takes advantage of Sam then Sam will feel happy\" is not common sense because generally, when someone takes advantage of another person, it results in negative feelings such as betrayal, hurt, or anger. The idea that taking advantage of someone would lead to happiness contradicts the typical emotional response one would expect in such a situation. Therefore, the statement does not align with common sense expectations of human emotional reactions.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1238, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex takes alex's pick he would assume his pick is always right.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that Alex has a high level of confidence in his own decisions, to the point where he would assume that any choice he makes is always correct. This could be indicative of overconfidence or a lack of consideration for other perspectives or possibilities. It is not necessarily common sense to assume that one's choices are always right, as mistakes and errors in judgment can happen to anyone. Critical thinking and openness to feedback are important for making well-rounded decisions. Therefore, the statement may not align with common sense, which typically involves considering various factors and potential outcomes.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1239, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex takes alex's pick he'll consider other options carefully too.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that if Alex chooses his own option, he will also evaluate other alternatives thoroughly. This indicates a thoughtful and cautious approach to decision-making, which is generally considered wise and prudent behavior. It is common sense to carefully consider all options before making a decision to ensure the best possible outcome. Therefore, this statement aligns with a common-sense approach to decision-making. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1240, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex takes sam a long time alex would assume that sam has been abducted by aliens and will never return.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement provided is not an example of common sense. Common sense typically involves practical and sound judgment based on simple perceptions of a situation or facts. Assuming that someone has been abducted by aliens and will never return, simply because they are taking a long time, is not a practical or realistic conclusion. It's an extreme and unlikely assumption that doesn't align with everyday reasoning or probability. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 1241, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex takes sam a long time they will make a chris.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex takes Sam a long time they will make a Chris\" is ambiguous and lacks clarity in meaning. It is not a logical or commonly understood statement as it does not specify what \"taking a long time\" entails or how it results in \"making a Chris.\" The use of names as verbs and the unclear relationship between the actions and the outcome make it difficult to determine any sensible interpretation or common sense within the statement. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 1242, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex takes sam word for it alex believes sam is right about everything.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex takes Sam's word for it, Alex believes Sam is right about everything\" implies that by accepting one thing that Sam says, Alex automatically believes that Sam is correct in all matters. This is an overgeneralization, as trusting someone's word on a specific issue does not necessarily mean that one believes the person is right about everything else. Trust can be context-specific and does not always extend to all topics or situations. Therefore, the statement lacks nuance and does not reflect a common understanding of trust or belief.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1243, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex takes sam word for it alex might experience negative feelings about sam if it later turns out to be untrue.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that if Alex trusts Sam's word and it turns out to be false, Alex may feel negatively towards Sam. This is based on the idea that trust is foundational in relationships, and a breach of trust can lead to disappointment, hurt, or betrayal. These negative feelings are a natural emotional response when expectations are not met, especially when it involves reliance on someone's honesty. Trust is essential for healthy relationships, and its violation can damage the relationship dynamics. \n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1244, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex takes sam word for it alex pretends they trust sam.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex takes Sam's word for it, Alex pretends they trust Sam\" suggests that Alex does not genuinely trust Sam but is only pretending to do so. This implies a lack of actual trust or confidence in Sam's honesty or reliability. In everyday interactions, taking someone's word for something generally indicates a level of trust in that person's truthfulness and integrity. Therefore, the statement contradicts the typical understanding of trust in interpersonal relationships.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1245, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex takes sam word for it alex would get lied to.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that Sam has a history or reputation of being dishonest, and therefore, trusting Sam's word would result in being deceived. The statement is implying that one should be cautious and perhaps seek additional verification before accepting what Sam says as truth. This is a common sense approach when dealing with individuals who have demonstrated untrustworthy behavior in the past. Therefore, the statement reflects a common sense perspective on handling interactions with someone known for dishonesty.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1246, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex takes sam word for it for answer.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex takes Sam's word for it for answer\" implies that Alex is choosing to trust and rely on the information or advice provided by Sam without independently verifying it. Whether this is common sense or not depends on the context, such as the nature of the information, the relationship and trustworthiness of Sam, and the potential consequences of accepting the information as true. In scenarios where Sam is a reliable and knowledgeable source, and the information doesn't have serious implications, it might be sensible for Alex to take Sam's word. However, in situations where accuracy is critical or Sam's expertise is uncertain, it would be prudent for Alex to seek further confirmation. \n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1247, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex takes sam word for it it is because the story seemed far fetched.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that Alex believes Sam's word because the story seemed far-fetched, which indicates that Alex finds the story to be so unbelievable that it must be true. This reasoning might not be common as people usually doubt or question far-fetched stories rather than readily accepting them. It is not typical to believe something just because it sounds implausible. Therefore, the statement does not align with common sense, which usually involves skepticism towards improbable stories.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1248, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex takes sam's allowance he would keep it safely for sam.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex takes Sam's allowance he would keep it safely for Sam\" assumes that Alex has good intentions and is trustworthy. However, taking someone else's allowance without permission can be considered stealing, which is generally not associated with trustworthiness or good intentions. Therefore, the statement may not align with common sense as it contradicts the general understanding of ethical behavior. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 1249, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex takes sam's allowance he would squander it.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex takes Sam's allowance he would squander it\" is not necessarily common sense, as it makes an assumption about Alex's behavior without any context or evidence. The statement presupposes that Alex is irresponsible with money, but without knowing Alex's spending habits or financial management skills, it is not reasonable to conclude that he would squander Sam's allowance. Therefore, it is not a common sense statement as it relies on an unfounded assumption.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1250, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex takes sam's allowance they would tell sam they stole it.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex takes Sam's allowance they would tell Sam they stole it\" is not necessarily common sense. Common sense suggests that a person who steals would typically try to hide their actions rather than openly confess to them. The statement assumes that Alex would behave in an atypical manner by admitting to the theft, which goes against the typical understanding of how people behave when they commit wrongdoing. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 1251, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex takes sam's family alex will feel responsible for the family.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex takes Sam's family, Alex will feel responsible for the family\" implies a sense of duty or obligation that naturally arises when someone takes on the care or guardianship of another person or group of people. It is common for individuals to feel a sense of responsibility when they voluntarily assume a role that involves looking after others, particularly in the context of family. This feeling of responsibility can stem from moral, ethical, or emotional motivations to ensure the well-being and proper care of the individuals involved. Therefore, it is reasonable to expect that Alex would feel responsible for Sam's family if he chose to take them under his care.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1252, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex takes sam's family alex will kill the kid.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex takes Sam's family, Alex will kill the kid\" is not a common sense statement. Common sense statements are typically based on general knowledge or practical reasoning that most people would agree upon. This statement, however, suggests a specific and extreme action that is not universally accepted or understood as reasonable. It is also not clear why taking someone's family would necessarily lead to killing, as there is no logical or ethical basis provided in the statement.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1253, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex takes sam's family out to dinner sam will be grateful.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex takes Sam's family out to dinner, Sam will be grateful\" relies on the assumption that taking someone's family out to dinner is a kind gesture that would be appreciated. Generally, treating someone's family to a meal could be seen as a considerate and generous act, which would likely elicit feelings of gratitude from the recipient. However, it's important to note that individual reactions can vary based on personal circumstances and relationships. Nonetheless, under typical social norms, this scenario would be viewed as a positive gesture. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1254, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex takes sam's shot at success sam will be upset.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that if Alex takes an opportunity meant for Sam, it would result in Sam feeling upset. This reasoning aligns with common human emotions, as individuals typically feel disappointed or frustrated when they lose a chance to succeed, especially if it is taken by someone else. It is a natural emotional response to feel upset in such a scenario.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1255, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex takes sam's shot run away from sam.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex takes Sam's shot, run away from Sam\" is unclear and lacks context, making it difficult to determine if it represents common sense. It's not clear what \"shot\" refers to, whether it's a literal injection or something metaphorical like a chance or opportunity. Without understanding the specifics of the situation, the directive to \"run away from Sam\" appears arbitrary and lacks a logical basis.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1256, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex takes sam's shot they will turn themselves in to the cops.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex takes Sam's shot they will turn themselves in to the cops\" is somewhat ambiguous and lacks context, making it difficult to determine if it's common sense. It's unclear what \"taking Sam's shot\" refers to, whether it's literally taking a shot meant for Sam or metaphorically taking the blame or responsibility for something Sam did. Additionally, the connection between taking the shot and turning oneself in to the cops is not logically explained in the statement. Without further context or clarification, it's hard to assess the sensibleness of the statement.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1257, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex takes some medicine they will feel better in a few hours.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex takes some medicine they will feel better in a few hours\" assumes that the medicine being taken is appropriate for whatever ailment Alex is experiencing and that it is effective in alleviating symptoms within a few hours. It is a common sense statement insofar as it reflects a general understanding that certain medications can provide relief for specific conditions in a relatively short period of time. However, the statement does not account for individual differences in response to medication, the severity of the condition, or whether the medication is indeed the correct one for the symptoms. Despite these nuances, the general expectation that appropriate medication can lead to feeling better is a common sense notion based on common experiences and knowledge about medicine's effects. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1258, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex takes some medicine they would take the wrong kind for their ailments.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex takes some medicine they would take the wrong kind for their ailments\" suggests that Alex would make a mistake in choosing the appropriate medication for their condition. This presupposes that Alex lacks the knowledge or ability to select the correct medicine, which may not be a fair or accurate assumption. People often select the correct medication based on symptoms, advice from healthcare providers, or information provided with the medicine. Without further context about Alex's medical knowledge or specific situation, it is not reasonable to assume they would inherently choose the wrong medicine. Therefore, the statement does not necessarily reflect common sense.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1259, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex takes the car he will drive into a lake because he wasn't paying attention.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement seems to suggest a hypothetical scenario in which Alex's lack of attention while driving leads to a specific outcome of driving into a lake. However, this statement is not necessarily common sense as it makes an assumption about Alex's behavior and the consequence without considering other factors such as road conditions, vehicle safety features, or external interventions. It also exaggerates the outcome based on one specific behavior, which is not a typical or logical conclusion. Therefore, it does not reflect a common-sense understanding of the situation.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1260, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex takes the car then they will drive until the car runs out of gas and park on the side of the road.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement seems to lack common sense because it assumes that Alex will continue driving until the car runs out of gas, which is not a practical or safe decision. Most people would plan their trip, monitor the fuel level, and refuel as needed to avoid being stranded on the side of the road. It also implies that Alex would knowingly allow the car to run out of gas, which is not a responsible action. Therefore, the statement does not reflect a common or sensible course of action. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 1261, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex takes the puppy they will announce it on social media.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex takes the puppy they will announce it on social media\" may not necessarily be common sense, as it depends on various factors such as Alex's personal habits, their use of social media, and their preference for sharing personal information online. Some people may choose to share significant life events on social media, while others may prefer to keep such matters private. Therefore, it cannot be assumed as a general rule that taking a puppy would automatically lead to an announcement on social media. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 1262, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex takes the puppy they will disguise how it looks.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex takes the puppy they will disguise how it looks\" is not necessarily a matter of common sense, as it involves assumptions about intentions and actions that are not universally predictable or typical. Common sense would suggest straightforward care and responsibility for a pet, rather than the specific and unusual action of disguising its appearance. This scenario might be more context-specific and could be related to particular circumstances not mentioned in the statement itself. Therefore, it does not align with general common sense expectations.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1263, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex takes the trash out they may put it in the recycling bin instead.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex takes the trash out they may put it in the recycling bin instead\" suggests that there is a possibility that Alex might mix up the regular trash with recyclable materials. This could happen due to confusion or lack of knowledge about proper waste disposal. It is common for people to mistakenly place items in the wrong bins, either recycling something that should be trashed or vice versa. Therefore, the statement reflects a realistic scenario that could happen. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1264, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex takes the trash out they will do it early enough for the trash man to get it.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement implies that Alex is responsible and timely when it comes to taking out the trash. It suggests that Alex is aware of the trash collection schedule and will ensure that the trash is taken out before the trash man arrives. This is a reasonable assumption to make about someone's behavior if they are generally responsible in other areas of their life. Therefore, the statement can be considered common sense as it aligns with typical expectations of responsible behavior.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1265, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex takes time off alex will spend the time both relaxing and catching up on work that's needed at home.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that during time off, Alex will balance relaxation with being productive by catching up on work at home. This seems reasonable as many people use time off to recharge while also tackling personal tasks they may not have time for otherwise. The idea of balancing relaxation with productivity during time off is a common approach for making effective use of free time.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1266, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex takes time off alex will spend the time partying and recklessly spending money.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement makes an assumption about Alex's behavior without any context or evidence to support the claim that Alex will spend their time off partying and recklessly spending money. People's behavior can vary greatly, and taking time off could be used for various activities including rest, travel, spending time with family, or pursuing hobbies. Assuming that Alex will specifically engage in partying and reckless spending is an overgeneralization.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1267, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex tans sam's hide they'll deserve it.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex tans Sam's hide they'll deserve it\" is a metaphorical expression, suggesting that if Alex disciplines or punishes Sam, it is because Sam did something to deserve it. The phrase \"tans someone's hide\" is an idiom that means to scold or punish someone. The statement assumes that the punishment is justified based on Sam's actions. Whether or not this statement is common sense depends on the context and the specifics of the situation, but generally, it implies a belief in fair consequences for actions. \n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1268, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex tans sam's hide they'll miss a spot.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex tans Sam's hide they'll miss a spot\" appears to be metaphorical rather than literal. In this context, it could be interpreted as a suggestion that if Alex attempts to reprimand or correct Sam, the effort may not be entirely thorough or effective. The phrase \"tans someone's hide\" is a colloquial expression for giving someone a punishment or a severe scolding, and \"missing a spot\" suggests an incomplete job. Therefore, the statement seems to rely on idiomatic expressions rather than factual common sense. \n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1269, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex teaches sam anything sam gets more ignorant.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex teaches Sam anything, Sam gets more ignorant\" is not necessarily common sense, as it relies on assumptions about Alex's teaching ability or the quality of information being shared. Common sense would suggest that teaching generally leads to increased knowledge and understanding, not increased ignorance. Additionally, the statement is a blanket generalization and doesn't consider variables such as the subject matter, the communication style, or the prior knowledge of the student. \n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1270, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex teaches sam anything sam will be very grateful.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement is based on the assumption that Sam will be grateful for being taught something by Alex. Gratitude is a common response to receiving help or knowledge from others, as it is a way to show appreciation. However, whether or not Sam will actually be grateful depends on various factors including Sam's personality, the nature of the information being taught, and the relationship between Alex and Sam. Without knowing these specifics, it's not possible to say for certain that Sam will be very grateful. Therefore, the statement cannot be considered common sense as it relies on assumptions that may not hold true in every situation. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 1271, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex teaches sam anything sam will punch alex.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex teaches Sam anything, Sam will punch Alex\" is not common sense because it implies that Sam has an irrational and violent reaction to learning from Alex, which is not a typical or reasonable response to being taught. In general, teaching and learning are positive interactions that do not provoke violence. The statement also lacks context about the relationship between Alex and Sam, or any justification for Sam's behavior, making it difficult to accept as common sense.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1272, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex teaches sam anything then sam is dumber now.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex teaches Sam anything then Sam is dumber now\" is not necessarily a reflection of common sense. Common sense suggests that teaching generally leads to learning and gaining knowledge, which would make someone smarter or more informed, not dumber. The statement may be based on a biased or unfounded assumption about Alex's teaching abilities or the nature of the information being taught. Without further context or evidence to support the claim that Alex's teaching negatively impacts Sam's intelligence, it is unreasonable to accept the statement as common sense. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 1273, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex tells sam had the flu alex will maintain a distance and take other precautions e g vaccination.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement reflects common sense as it involves taking preventive measures to avoid contracting the flu, a contagious illness. When informed that someone is ill, maintaining distance and considering vaccination are logical steps to protect one's health. These precautions align with general health guidelines to prevent the spread of infectious diseases. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1274, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex tells sam had the flu they will avoid sam.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex tells Sam had the flu they will avoid Sam\" is based on the idea that people generally want to avoid getting sick and will take precautions to protect themselves from contagious illnesses. Avoiding close contact with someone who has the flu is a common sense measure to prevent the spread of the virus. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that if Alex informs someone that Sam has the flu, they would likely avoid Sam to protect their own health. \n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1275, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex tells sam had the flu they would ask sam to share their drink with them.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement is not common sense. If Alex tells Sam that they have the flu, it would be unreasonable for Sam to ask to share their drink, as the flu is a contagious illness. Sharing a drink could increase the risk of transmission of the virus. Therefore, it would be more sensible for Sam to avoid sharing a drink to prevent getting sick. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 1276, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex tells sam had the flu they would keep their distance and not share food or drinks with sam.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement reflects a common understanding of how contagious illnesses like the flu are transmitted, primarily through close contact and sharing items that come into contact with the mouth, such as food and drinks. By keeping a distance and not sharing food or drinks, Alex would be taking reasonable precautions to avoid catching the flu from Sam. This aligns with general health guidelines and common practices for preventing the spread of infectious diseases. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1277, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex tells sam's anything then they might speak in a language that the second person doesn't understand.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement seems to imply that there is a possibility that Alex and Sam may not share a common language or that one might use a language the other doesn't understand. However, without any context about Alex and Sam's language abilities or backgrounds, it is difficult to definitively say that this scenario is likely or common. It is possible that they both speak the same language fluently, making the statement less sensible. Therefore, the statement does not necessarily reflect common sense as it relies on assumptions without any given context.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1278, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex texts sam back he will get annoyed if he doesn't get a reply immediately.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that Alex has an expectation for an immediate response when he texts Sam. While it is not uncommon for some people to feel impatient or frustrated when they do not receive prompt replies to their messages, it is not a universal reaction. Different individuals have different levels of tolerance and expectations when it comes to communication response times. Therefore, it is not accurate to generalize this behavior as common sense, as it can vary greatly depending on the person's disposition and the context of the communication.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1279, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex texts sam back he'll patiently await a response.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that if Alex texts Sam back, he will wait for a response patiently. This behavior is generally expected in texting etiquette, where one person responds and then waits for a reply from the other person. It indicates a respectful and considerate communication style, which is commonly practiced and understood. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1280, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex throws sam a surprise birthday party alex would tell all of the invitees to tell sam about it beforehand.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement does not align with common sense because the purpose of a surprise party is for it to be unexpected by the guest of honor. If Alex tells all of the invitees to inform Sam about the party beforehand, it would defeat the purpose of it being a surprise. Therefore, the statement contradicts the fundamental idea of a surprise party. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 1281, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex throws sam a surprise birthday party he she is careful to consider what sam would enjoy.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement reflects common sense as it emphasizes the importance of considering the preferences and enjoyment of the person for whom the surprise birthday party is being thrown. Throwing a party that aligns with Sam's interests and tastes would likely make the event more enjoyable and memorable for Sam. It's considerate and thoughtful to tailor the party to the guest of honor's preferences, which is a basic principle of good party planning. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1282, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex throws sam a surprise party but makes sure to tell no one who can't keep a secret about it.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement reflects a common strategy to ensure the party remains a surprise. By selectively telling only those who can keep a secret, Alex minimizes the risk of the surprise being revealed to Sam prematurely. This is a logical approach to maintain the element of surprise in planning a surprise party.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1283, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex throws sam a surprise party but posts publicly on facebook that they're planning a surprise party for sam.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement lacks common sense because throwing a surprise party requires secrecy and discretion. Posting publicly on Facebook about the surprise party would defeat the purpose of it being a surprise, as Sam could easily see the post or be informed about it by others. Therefore, it is not logical or sensible to publicly announce a plan that is intended to be a secret.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1284, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex throws sam a surprise party he will invite too many people.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex throws Sam a surprise party he will invite too many people\" is not necessarily common sense because it relies on assumptions about Alex's behavior and judgment that may not be universally true. Common sense would suggest that the number of people invited to a party would depend on the preferences of the person organizing the event and the expectations or desires of the person for whom the party is being thrown. Without specific knowledge of Alex's tendencies or past behavior in similar situations, it is not reasonable to assume that he will definitely invite too many people. Therefore, the statement cannot be considered common sense as it is based on an unfounded generalization.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1285, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex throws sam a surprise party he will keep it a surprise.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex throws Sam a surprise party he will keep it a surprise\" is generally aligned with the definition of a surprise party, which is an event planned secretly to surprise the guest of honor. If Alex were to disclose the details of the party to Sam, it would no longer be a surprise. Therefore, the statement is logically consistent with the nature of a surprise party and can be considered common sense. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1286, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex throws sam a surprise party they will not let on about the party so that it will truly be a surprise.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement implies that in order for the party to be a surprise, Alex and others involved should keep it a secret from Sam. This is a logical approach to ensure that the event remains unexpected, maintaining the element of surprise which is the essence of a surprise party. Therefore, it is common sense to not let on about the party to the person being surprised.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1287, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex tosses it back alex forgets to catch it.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex tosses it back, Alex forgets to catch it\" implies that Alex consistently forgets to catch something he tosses back. This seems illogical as tossing and catching are typically related actions and forgetting to catch something one has tossed does not follow naturally. Additionally, the statement doesn't provide any context that would explain why Alex would consistently forget to catch something he himself tossed. Therefore, it does not align with common sense. \n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1288, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex tosses it back tails is the practice of throwing a coin in the air.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement seems to be mixing two different concepts. Tossing a coin in the air and it landing on tails is a common practice to randomly determine an outcome, but the phrasing \"tails is the practice of throwing a coin in the air\" is not accurate. The practice itself is called a coin toss or coin flip, and \"tails\" is just one of the two possible outcomes of this practice, the other being \"heads.\" Therefore, the statement as phrased is not common sense because it incorrectly defines \"tails\" as a practice rather than an outcome. \n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1289, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex tosses it back then sam will walk away.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex tosses it back then Sam will walk away\" is not necessarily common sense, as it lacks context and specific details about the situation and relationship between Alex and Sam. Without knowing what \"it\" refers to, and what the implications are for Sam if Alex tosses \"it\" back, it is difficult to determine if the statement aligns with common sense. Common sense typically involves judgments or understandings that are widely agreed upon based on shared experiences, and this statement does not provide enough information to determine if it meets that criteria. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 1290, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex tries to reassure sam alex will give examples to sam when they succeeded.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex tries to reassure Sam, Alex will give examples to Sam when they succeeded\" suggests that Alex would use past successes as a way to provide encouragement and build confidence in Sam. This is a common method of reassurance, as reminding someone of their previous accomplishments can help them feel more capable and optimistic about facing current challenges. It is a logical and effective way to boost someone's morale.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1291, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex tries to reassure sam he will be nonjudgmental.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex tries to reassure Sam he will be nonjudgmental\" suggests that Alex's reassurance is intended to convey a sense of acceptance and openness, free from criticism or judgment. This is a common communication strategy used to build trust and create a safe space for open dialogue. By reassuring Sam of his nonjudgmental stance, Alex is likely trying to encourage honest communication and alleviate any fears of being judged. This approach is commonly understood as effective in fostering positive interpersonal interactions. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1292, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex tries to reassure sam they may end up giving bad advice.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex tries to reassure Sam, they may end up giving bad advice\" suggests that the act of reassuring someone could lead to providing advice that is not helpful or appropriate. This could happen if Alex lacks enough information about the situation, if they are not skilled in giving advice, or if they prioritize comforting Sam over providing accurate guidance. In these cases, their intention to reassure could result in advice that isn't well-considered or beneficial.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that the statement isn\u2019t always true. The outcome heavily depends on Alex's understanding of the situation and their ability to communicate effectively. Reassuring someone does not inherently lead to bad advice unless the reassurance is based on incorrect assumptions or misinformation.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1293, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex tries to reassure sam they will fail and tell sam that they are stupid.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex tries to reassure Sam they will fail and tell Sam that they are stupid\" is not common sense. Reassuring someone typically involves providing support, comfort, and encouragement. Telling someone they are stupid would be contradictory to the goal of reassurance and would likely undermine their confidence, rather than bolster it. Therefore, it is not logical or common sense to assume that an attempt to reassure would include insulting the person being reassured. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 1294, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex turns sam away alex is a fool to behave injuriously and burn a bridge.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that rejecting or pushing away someone, in this case, Sam, may have negative consequences for Alex, such as damaging a relationship or losing an opportunity. It implies that it is unwise to behave in a way that could harm oneself in the future. This perspective aligns with the common-sense notion that maintaining positive relationships and connections is generally beneficial and that burning bridges can lead to missed opportunities or regrets. Therefore, the statement can be seen as reflecting a common-sense approach to interpersonal relationships. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1295, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex turns sam away he would still stay still and stare.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that even if Alex turns Sam away, Sam would remain motionless and continue to look in the same direction. This could be interpreted as Sam being determined, stubborn, or fixated on something. However, without additional context about the relationship between Alex and Sam, or the circumstances leading to this situation, it is difficult to determine if this reaction is common sense. People's reactions can vary widely depending on their personalities, emotions, and the context of the situation. Therefore, the statement may not necessarily align with common sense as it assumes a specific reaction without considering other factors.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1296, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex turns sam away he would walk away with pride.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex turns Sam away he would walk away with pride\" is subjective and depends on the personality and emotional state of the character Sam. The statement assumes that Sam has enough self-respect and confidence to maintain his pride even in the face of rejection. However, without additional context about Sam's character traits and the nature of his relationship with Alex, it is difficult to definitively determine whether this statement aligns with common sense. Common sense would typically require an understanding of the individuals involved and the situation to make an accurate judgment. Therefore, the statement may not necessarily be a common sense conclusion for every scenario. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 1297, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex turns things around he she would keep mopping.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex turns things around he/she would keep mopping\" seems to lack logical coherence, as the phrase \"turns things around\" typically refers to improving a situation or changing behavior, which does not directly relate to the act of continuing to mop. In everyday speech, one would expect a different outcome or action to be described as a result of turning things around, rather than persisting in the same task of mopping. Therefore, the statement does not align with common sense expectations of cause and effect. \n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1298, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex uploads the video alex expects there would be some viewers.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex uploads the video, Alex expects there would be some viewers\" is based on the reasonable assumption that when someone uploads a video, it is typically with the intention of sharing it with an audience. Uploading a video to a platform implies that it will be accessible to others who can view it. Therefore, it is common sense for Alex to expect that there will be some viewers after uploading a video, as the purpose of uploading is to reach an audience.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1299, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex uploads the video alex forgets to publish it.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex uploads the video, Alex forgets to publish it\" suggests a cause-and-effect relationship where uploading the video leads to forgetting to publish it. However, uploading and publishing are typically sequential steps in sharing a video online and one does not necessarily cause the other. Forgetting to publish a video could be due to various reasons such as distraction, multitasking, or oversight, and is not inherently linked to the act of uploading. Therefore, the statement does not represent a common sense or logical relationship.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1300, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex uploads the video he will click the delete button if it was a mistake.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex uploads the video he will click the delete button if it was a mistake\" is based on the assumption that Alex would want to correct an error by removing an mistakenly uploaded video. This reflects a common understanding that people generally prefer to rectify their mistakes when possible, especially in a context like uploading a video where unintended content could have consequences. Therefore, the statement aligns with general logical behavior and common sense in handling errors in digital content management.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1301, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex uploads the video he will unplug the computer if it was a mistake.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex uploads the video he will unplug the computer if it was a mistake\" is not common sense. Common sense would suggest that if uploading the video was a mistake, Alex would take steps to rectify the mistake, such as deleting the video from the platform it was uploaded to, rather than simply unplugging the computer. Unplugging the computer would not necessarily solve the issue of the mistakenly uploaded video being publicly accessible. Therefore, the statement does not align with a practical or effective response to the situation described.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1302, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex uploads the video he would pay attention to the aftermath.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that if Alex uploads a video, he would be mindful of the consequences or reactions that follow. This can be considered common sense because it is generally prudent and responsible to consider the impact of one's actions, especially when sharing content publicly, which can have various repercussions. Monitoring the aftermath of a video upload can help Alex address any feedback, respond to comments, or manage any potential issues that arise.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1303, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex uploads the video he wouldn't care for the outcome.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that Alex is indifferent to the consequences of uploading the video. Common sense would dictate that most people would consider potential outcomes before taking an action that could have significant repercussions, especially in the context of sharing content publicly. Uploading a video could have various implications, both positive and negative, and typically one would care about the impact it might have. Therefore, the statement does not align with what would generally be considered common sense, as most individuals would exhibit some level of concern or consideration about the results of their actions.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1304, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex walks around a bit they will not move.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex walks around a bit they will not move\" appears to be contradictory and lacks clarity. Generally, \"walking around\" implies some form of movement, either by Alex or within the environment. If the statement is suggesting that other objects or people will not move as a result of Alex walking around, it needs further contextual information to be evaluated for common sense. Without additional context to clarify what \"they\" refers to and in what circumstances this would hold true, the statement seems illogical on its face as it contradicts the typical understanding of cause and effect related to movement.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1305, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex wants a new look he change his style and outfits.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that if Alex wants a new look, he can achieve this by changing his style and outfits. This is a logical approach as changing one's style and outfits can significantly alter one's appearance, which is essentially what a new look entails. It is a common understanding that to refresh or update one's appearance, adjustments in fashion and personal style are effective methods. Therefore, the statement aligns with general knowledge about how to achieve a new look.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1306, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex wants a new look he she is a fool to betray their own sense of style in favor of being trendy.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement implies that staying true to one's own sense of style is more valuable than simply following trends. It suggests that maintaining individuality and authenticity in personal appearance is important, and that betraying one\u2019s own sense of style to be trendy may not be a wise decision. It can be seen as common sense because it promotes self-confidence and self-expression, which are generally considered positive traits. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1307, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex wants a new look he she is careful to consider their own sense of style before considering what is trendy.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that an individual prioritizes their personal style over following trends when considering a new look. This approach is logical as it ensures that the individual feels comfortable and authentic in their appearance, rather than simply conforming to popular fashion. By staying true to their own sense of style, a person is likely to feel more confident and self-assured. Therefore, this statement reflects a common-sense approach to personal style and fashion choices. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1308, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex wants a new look they only consider a single option.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that Alex only considers one option when seeking a new look, which may not align with common sense as people often explore multiple possibilities to find the best fit for their desired change. Common sense would dictate that considering various options allows for better decision-making by comparing different styles, prices, and opinions. Therefore, it is not typical or practical for someone to limit themselves to a single option when making a significant change like updating their look.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1309, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex wants someone to mow their lawn it gets done by a company.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex wants someone to mow their lawn it gets done by a company\" implies that Alex hires a professional service to take care of the lawn mowing, rather than doing it themselves or having someone else do it informally. This could be a common scenario if Alex prefers the convenience and reliability of a professional service, values the quality of their work, or lacks the time or equipment to do it themselves. However, without additional context about Alex's preferences, resources, or specific situation, it is difficult to definitively say this is a common-sense statement as it may not hold true for everyone.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1310, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex wants someone to take their trash out it is because they are too lazy to do it themselves.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement makes an assumption about Alex's motives without considering other potential reasons for wanting someone else to take out the trash. Alex may have physical limitations, time constraints, or other responsibilities that prevent them from doing the task themselves. It's not necessarily a matter of laziness. Without more context about Alex's situation, it's unfair to generalize their motives as simply being lazy. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 1311, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex wants to be a teacher morgan will discourage alex with negative reasons of becoming a teacher.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement does not necessarily reflect common sense, as it assumes a specific and negative response from Morgan without providing context for their relationship or Morgan's reasoning. Common sense would suggest that whether or not Morgan discourages Alex would depend on various factors including their relationship, Morgan's personal beliefs about the teaching profession, and Alex's aptitude and passion for teaching. Without further context, it is not reasonable to assume that Morgan will automatically discourage Alex with negative reasons.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1312, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex wants to be a teacher they will simply show up at a school and ask for a job.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement, \"If Alex wants to be a teacher they will simply show up at a school and ask for a job,\" does not align with common sense. Typically, becoming a teacher requires specific qualifications, such as a degree in education and a teaching license or certification. Additionally, there are formal hiring processes in place at schools which often involve submitting an application, going through interviews, and sometimes background checks. Simply showing up at a school and asking for a job is unlikely to be sufficient or effective. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 1313, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex wants to be a teacher they would apply for a teaching position.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex wants to be a teacher they would apply for a teaching position\" suggests that taking action to apply for a teaching position is a logical step for someone who has the desire to become a teacher. Applying for a position is a necessary step in pursuing a career in teaching, as it is the means by which one can obtain a job in the field. Therefore, the statement aligns with common sense, as it reflects a natural and practical course of action for achieving the goal of becoming a teacher. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1314, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex wants to be a teacher they would become a painter.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex wants to be a teacher they would become a painter\" does not follow common sense. Generally, wanting to become a teacher would imply pursuing a career in education, involving activities such as obtaining teaching credentials, studying educational theories, and gaining experience in classroom management. Becoming a painter, on the other hand, involves a different skill set and career path focused on visual arts and creative expression. The two professions, while both valuable, do not directly correlate in terms of career goals and the necessary steps to achieve them. Therefore, the statement does not logically align with common sense expectations of career progression based on the expressed desire to be a teacher.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1315, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex wants to fight sam then the first person would give the second person a compliment.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex wants to fight Sam then the first person would give the second person a compliment\" does not align with common sense. Typically, if someone wants to fight another person, it suggests feelings of anger or hostility, not kindness or admiration that would be expressed through a compliment. The logical connection between wanting to fight and giving a compliment is not clear or reasonable based on usual human behavior and social norms. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 1316, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex wants to fight sam then the first person would punch the second person on the body.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement assumes that if one person wants to fight another, physical violence in the form of punching will occur. However, wanting to fight does not necessarily mean physical violence will happen. People can express anger or conflict through verbal disagreements or by seeking mediation or other non-violent means. The statement also oversimplifies the possible responses to conflict and does not consider alternatives to physical aggression.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1317, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex wants to vote they might forget to register.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex wants to vote they might forget to register\" suggests that there is a possibility of forgetting to register to vote even when there is a desire to participate in voting. This could be considered common sense as it reflects a common human tendency to overlook or procrastinate on necessary tasks, even when they are important or desired. People often get caught up in their daily lives and might miss deadlines or forget to complete required steps like voter registration.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1318, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex wants to vote they will do in depth research on the candidates.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex wants to vote they will do in-depth research on the candidates\" suggests that Alex takes their voting responsibility seriously and wants to make an informed decision. While it is common sense that informed voting is important and beneficial for a democracy, it is not necessarily common sense to assume that every individual voter, including Alex, will conduct in-depth research. Voting behavior varies widely among individuals, and not everyone may have the time, resources, or inclination to research thoroughly. Therefore, the statement is not universally applicable to all voters or situations.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1319, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex wants to write a story and they think somehow the story will just get written without any work.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement implies that Alex expects a story to be written without putting in any effort, which is not a realistic expectation. Writing a story requires planning, creativity, and dedication. It is a process that involves actively engaging in writing, revising, and editing. Therefore, the idea that a story can be written without any work goes against common sense, which dictates that effort is necessary to achieve a goal.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1320, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex wants to write a story so they sit down and begin writing it.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex wants to write a story so they sit down and begin writing it\" implies that a person who has a desire to write a story takes action to fulfill that desire by sitting down and starting to write. This is a logical progression of events and aligns with common sense, as it is typical for individuals to take steps to pursue their interests or goals when they have the motivation to do so. Therefore, the statement reflects a common-sense approach to achieving a personal objective.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1321, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex wants to write a story they find glue and sparkles but no pencil.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex wants to write a story they find glue and sparkles but no pencil\" does not align with common sense because writing typically requires a writing instrument, such as a pencil or pen, rather than glue and sparkles. Glue and sparkles are more commonly associated with crafting and decorating rather than writing. Therefore, the lack of a pencil would hinder Alex's ability to write a story effectively. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 1322, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex wants to write a story they get a piece of paper and a pen and sit down to work.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex wants to write a story they get a piece of paper and a pen and sit down to work\" seems to be based on common sense as it outlines a logical and straightforward approach to beginning the task of writing. It implies that having the necessary tools (paper and pen) and being in a conducive position (sitting down) are basic prerequisites to starting the writing process. This is a typical and practical method for many people when they want to write something down.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1323, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex wants to write a story they should not copy and paste from the computer.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex wants to write a story they should not copy and paste from the computer\" is emphasizing originality and creativity in writing. Copying and pasting from the computer can lead to plagiarism, which is unethical and illegal. It can also hinder personal growth and development in writing skills. Additionally, original content is more valuable and respected. Therefore, it is common sense to avoid copying and pasting if the goal is to write an authentic story. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1324, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex wants to write a story they would be inspired by viewing art in a museum.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that viewing art in a museum can serve as a source of inspiration for writing a story. This idea is rooted in the understanding that art can evoke emotions, ideas, and creativity, which can be channeled into writing. Museums offer a diverse range of artworks that can stimulate the imagination and provide new perspectives, potentially enriching the storytelling process. Many writers and artists have historically found inspiration in the works of others, making the connection between viewing art and creative writing plausible.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1325, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex watches alex's favorite movie they would sit on the couch.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex watches Alex's favorite movie they would sit on the couch\" involves a typical scenario where someone watches a movie in a comfortable setting, such as a couch. It is common for people to watch movies while sitting on a couch, as it provides comfort and a good viewing angle. The statement doesn't include any unusual or extraordinary circumstances that would make it counterintuitive or uncommon. Therefore, the statement aligns with what is typically expected when someone watches a movie. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1326, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex watches alex's favorite movie they would throw a remote at the tv.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement does not represent common sense. Common sense would suggest that if someone watches their favorite movie, they would enjoy it and have a positive experience. The idea of throwing a remote at the TV suggests anger or frustration, which contradicts the notion of it being a favorite movie. Therefore, the statement is not aligned with typical logical reasoning or common sense. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 1327, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex watches the movie together they would make sure they have snacks.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex watches the movie together they would make sure they have snacks\" involves the common practice of enjoying snacks while watching a movie, which is a popular and widespread activity. Many people associate movie watching with having snacks like popcorn, chips, or candy as it enhances the viewing experience. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that if Alex and others are planning to watch a movie together, they would consider having snacks as part of the experience.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1328, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex wears pants he wears them on his arms.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex wears pants he wears them on his arms\" does not align with common sense because pants are generally designed and intended to be worn on the legs, not on the arms. Clothing has specific purposes and conventional ways of being worn, and wearing pants on the arms would be highly unconventional and impractical. Therefore, the statement contradicts typical expectations and norms about how pants are worn. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 1329, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex wins something he might not know the next line of action.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex wins something he might not know the next line of action\" suggests uncertainty in knowing what to do after achieving a victory. This could be common if Alex lacks experience, planning, or guidance for post-win scenarios. However, without additional context about Alex's knowledge, skills, or the nature of what he won, it's hard to definitively say that it's common sense. Common sense typically relies on general, widely accepted knowledge and practical judgment, which may not apply to specific individual cases without further information. Therefore, while it's possible for someone to be unsure of their next steps after a win, it's not necessarily common sense to assume so universally.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1330, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex wins something they will claim their prize.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex wins something they will claim their prize\" implies that when someone wins a prize, they will naturally want to claim it as it is a reward for their achievement. Generally, people are motivated to receive rewards or prizes that they have earned, making it a common expectation that winners will claim their prizes. Therefore, the statement aligns with typical human behavior and common sense expectations.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1331, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex wins something they would feel proud.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex wins something they would feel proud\" is based on the general human emotion of pride that is commonly associated with achievement or success. Winning typically triggers a sense of accomplishment and satisfaction, which aligns with the emotion of pride. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that if Alex were to win something, they would experience feelings of pride.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1332, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex wins something they would throw it away.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex wins something they would throw it away\" does not seem to align with common sense without additional context. Generally, winning implies receiving something of value or desirability, and it would be unusual for someone to intentionally discard a prize or reward without a specific reason. Unless Alex has a known pattern of behavior or a particular disdain for winning or the items won, the statement lacks a logical foundation. Therefore, it does not appear to be common sense.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1333, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex works alex's fingers to the bone he will not be able to work anymore.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that if Alex works excessively hard, he will reach a point where he physically cannot work anymore due to exhaustion or injury. This is a logical conclusion, as overworking can lead to physical and mental burnout, making it impossible to continue working effectively. Therefore, it aligns with common sense that pushing oneself too hard can lead to a decrease in productivity or a complete inability to work. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1334, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex works alex's fingers to the bone he will take a break so he can work more after his break.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that working excessively hard will lead to a break, and that the break is taken with the intention of being able to work more afterward. This can be seen as a logical approach to maintaining productivity and preventing burnout. Taking breaks is important for physical and mental recovery, which in turn can enhance overall efficiency and effectiveness when returning to work. Therefore, the idea of taking a break after working extremely hard in order to continue working effectively afterward aligns with common sense principles of work-life balance and self-care.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1335, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex works alex's fingers to the bone he would ignore.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex works his fingers to the bone he would ignore\" lacks clarity on what Alex would ignore, and the connection between working extremely hard and ignoring something is not logically clear. Common sense would suggest that working hard might lead to fatigue or stress, but it does not necessarily imply ignoring something or someone. Without a clear cause-and-effect relationship or more context, it's difficult to say that this statement aligns with common sense. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 1336, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex works alex's fingers to the bone he would scream in pain.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex works his fingers to the bone he would scream in pain\" is based on the idea that overexertion or extreme physical effort can lead to pain. Working \"to the bone\" is a figurative expression that implies working extremely hard or excessively, potentially causing physical harm or discomfort. It is common knowledge that intense or excessive physical effort can lead to pain or injury. Therefore, if Alex were to truly work his fingers to such an extreme extent, it is reasonable to expect that he would experience significant pain, potentially causing him to scream. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1337, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex works alex's fingers to the bone they will keep working despite it being terrible for them physically.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement implies that Alex will continue working hard even if it is detrimental to their physical health. This suggests a strong work ethic and determination, but also a lack of regard for personal well-being. It is not common sense to ignore the physical consequences of overworking, as this can lead to serious health issues and decreased productivity in the long run. Therefore, while the statement may be true in certain situations where individuals prioritize work over health, it is not advisable or sensible as a general approach. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 1338, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex works alex's fingers to the bone they will rest for awhile to regain energy.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that if Alex works extremely hard and exhausts himself, he will need to rest to regain energy. This is consistent with the understanding that the human body requires rest and recovery after intense physical exertion to prevent injury and restore energy levels. Therefore, the statement aligns with common sense as it reflects a basic understanding of the body's need for rest after strenuous activity.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1339, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex works the night shift might work in the morning.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex works the night shift, he might work in the morning\" does not seem to be common sense because working the night shift typically implies that an individual is working during nighttime hours and would therefore be unlikely to also work in the morning immediately following. Typically, individuals require rest after working a night shift and would not be scheduled for a morning shift right after. Thus, the statement lacks logical consistency with typical work scheduling practices.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1340, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex works the night shift they complete it successfully.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex works the night shift they complete it successfully\" implies a cause-and-effect relationship where Alex's working the night shift guarantees successful completion. However, without additional context about Alex's skills, experience, or the nature of the work, it's difficult to determine if this is a common-sense statement. Success on a job can depend on various factors including the complexity of tasks, available resources, and individual capabilities. Assuming success based solely on participation in a shift lacks a comprehensive consideration of these factors. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 1341, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex works the night shift they will sleep during the day so they are awake for work.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement is based on the logical reasoning that if someone works during the night, they would need to sleep during the day in order to be well-rested and alert for their shift. This aligns with the natural human need for adequate sleep to function effectively. Working at night goes against the typical circadian rhythm, which is why adjusting sleep patterns is necessary to accommodate nighttime work hours. Therefore, the statement reflects a common and practical approach to managing one's sleep schedule when working night shifts. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1342, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex works the night shift they will stay completely awake the day before.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex works the night shift they will stay completely awake the day before\" suggests that Alex would deprive themselves of sleep before working a night shift in order to adjust their sleep schedule. However, staying completely awake the day before a night shift may not be practical or healthy, as it could lead to excessive fatigue and decreased alertness during the night shift. A more common approach might be to take a nap or adjust sleep gradually rather than staying awake for an extended period. Therefore, the statement may not represent a common-sense approach to preparing for a night shift. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 1343, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex works the night shift they would fall asleep.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex works the night shift they would fall asleep\" suggests that working during nighttime hours could lead to fatigue and sleepiness, which is a common physiological response to being awake during typical sleeping hours. Our bodies have natural circadian rhythms that dictate periods of wakefulness and sleepiness, usually aligning sleep during the night. Therefore, it makes sense that working a night shift could disrupt these rhythms and cause someone to fall asleep due to increased tiredness. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1344, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex works well alex spends the rest of the day doing nothing.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex works well, Alex spends the rest of the day doing nothing,\" implies a reward or relaxation period after a productive work session. This idea may resonate with some people who believe in taking breaks or rewarding themselves after completing tasks effectively. However, it's not a universal principle or common sense, as work habits and personal motivations vary widely among individuals. Some might continue working or switch to other productive activities instead of doing nothing.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1345, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex works well than alex works at a well.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex works well then Alex works at a well\" is not common sense because it involves a play on words and does not logically follow. The phrase \"works well\" generally means performing a job competently or efficiently, while \"works at a well\" implies physically working at a location where water is drawn. These two meanings are unrelated, and doing one does not imply doing the other. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 1346, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex works well they will be frustrated with their performance.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex works well they will be frustrated with their performance\" seems counterintuitive because generally, working well would lead to satisfaction or a sense of accomplishment, not frustration. Frustration is typically associated with poor performance or facing obstacles that hinder good performance. Thus, if Alex is working well, it would be more logical to expect positive feelings about their performance rather than frustration.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1347, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex works well they will usually be rewarded for their efforts.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex works well they will usually be rewarded for their efforts\" is based on the general principle that hard work and good performance often lead to positive outcomes such as recognition, promotions, or other rewards. This idea is widely accepted in many cultures and professional environments as a way to motivate individuals to strive for excellence and contribute positively. Therefore, it aligns with common sense expectations that effort and merit are usually acknowledged and appreciated.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1348, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex would run he would run around the brick building instead of running into it.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex would run he would run around the brick building instead of running into it\" is based on the assumption that a person would choose a safer and more logical path when running. Running into a building could result in injury or an obstruction, whereas running around it allows for unimpeded movement. It is common sense to choose a path that avoids obstacles and potential harm.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1349, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If alex would run into a brick wall he would smash his face.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Alex would run into a brick wall he would smash his face\" is based on the understanding of basic physics and human vulnerability. Running into a solid, immovable object like a brick wall at any significant speed would likely result in physical injury, including potential damage to the face. The outcome described is a logical consequence of the action mentioned. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1350, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If elected i will demand accountability for your tax dollars.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement, \"If elected I will demand accountability for your tax dollars,\" reflects a common expectation that elected officials should be responsible and transparent with public funds. Taxpayers generally want assurance that their money is being used effectively and efficiently for the public good. Accountability is a fundamental principle in public administration and governance. Therefore, demanding accountability aligns with the basic responsibilities of an elected official to oversee and ensure proper management of government resources.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1351, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If everything seems to be going well you have obviously overlooked something.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that if everything appears to be going smoothly, there must be an issue or problem that has been missed. This implies a pessimistic view that perfection or complete success is unattainable, and that one should always be vigilant for potential problems. In reality, while it is wise to be cautious and prepared for unexpected challenges, it is not necessarily true that something always has to be wrong if things are going well. Success and smooth progress can be achieved, although it is important to remain observant and proactive in addressing any potential issues that may arise. However, the statement generalizes that oversight is inevitable when things are going well, which is not always the case.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1352, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If fortune wishes to make a man estimable she gives him virtues if she wishes to make him esteemed she gives him success.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that virtues and success are both gifts from fortune, but they have different effects on how a man is perceived. Virtues make a man estimable, meaning he is worthy of respect for his moral qualities. Success, on the other hand, makes a man esteemed, implying that he is admired or respected for his achievements or status. This distinction highlights that being a good person and being perceived as successful are not necessarily the same thing. It also suggests that societal perception is influenced by external success rather than internal virtues. This statement aligns with common observations about how people often value success and achievements over moral character in their judgments of others. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1353, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If higher education is not repeatedly emphasized in the home from a younger age it is not going to be of interest to students.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that emphasizing higher education in the home from a young age is crucial for developing an interest in it among students. While it is true that parental influence and early exposure to the idea of higher education can play a significant role in shaping a child's aspirations, it is not the only factor that determines a student's interest in pursuing further education. Other factors such as individual motivation, peer influence, school environment, access to resources, and personal experiences also contribute significantly to a student's interest in higher education. Therefore, it is an oversimplification to claim that lack of emphasis on higher education at home will invariably lead to a lack of interest in it. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 1354, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If it ain't broke don't fix it.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If it ain't broke don't fix it\" implies that one should not attempt to alter or fix something that is already functioning properly. This can be considered common sense because unnecessary intervention could potentially create new problems or complications. It encourages a practical and cautious approach to problem-solving by focusing resources and efforts on things that actually need attention. It can also promote efficiency and prevent wasting time and resources.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1355, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If it aint in source control then it doesn't exist.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If it ain't in source control then it doesn't exist\" underscores the importance of using version control systems in software development. Source control, or version control, helps teams manage changes to code and maintain a history of modifications, which is crucial for collaboration, backup, and accountability. If code or changes are not committed to a version control system, they are not officially recorded, shared among team members, or safeguarded against loss. This lack of formal tracking and versioning can lead to inconsistencies, accidental overwrites, and difficulties in reverting to previous states or auditing changes. Therefore, the statement emphasizes the necessity of using source control as a fundamental practice to ensure the existence and persistence of code changes in a collaborative software development environment. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1356, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If jake adopts a dog it would destroy his livelihood.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Jake adopts a dog it would destroy his livelihood\" is not necessarily common sense without additional context. The impact of adopting a dog on Jake's livelihood would depend on various factors, such as the nature of Jake's job, his living situation, and whether he has the resources and time to care for a dog responsibly. Without knowing these specifics, it's difficult to determine if adopting a dog would indeed have such a drastic effect on his livelihood. Therefore, the statement cannot be considered common sense on its own. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 1357, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If jake brings mary a spare key he would leave it in their mailbox without telling her about it.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement does not exhibit common sense because leaving a spare key in the mailbox without informing the recipient could compromise security. If Mary is unaware of the key's location, it could potentially be found and used by unauthorized persons. Additionally, informing Mary about the key's placement would ensure that she retrieves it in a timely manner and does not face any inconvenience due to being locked out. Therefore, it would be more sensible for Jake to communicate with Mary about the spare key arrangement.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1358, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If jake brushes mary teeth he would ask permission first.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement, \"If Jake brushes Mary's teeth he would ask permission first,\" aligns with the common sense notion of respecting personal boundaries and obtaining consent before engaging in actions that involve another person's body. Brushing someone else's teeth is a personal and intimate activity, and it is generally expected that one would seek permission before performing such an act to ensure comfort and respect for the individual's autonomy.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1359, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If jake completes his education he would feel satisfied.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Jake completes his education he would feel satisfied\" is based on the common assumption that achieving educational goals leads to a sense of accomplishment and satisfaction. Education is often associated with personal growth, improved career opportunities, and increased self-esteem, all of which can contribute to overall satisfaction. However, individual experiences and feelings of satisfaction can vary widely depending on personal values, goals, and external circumstances. Without knowing Jake's specific motivations and expectations regarding his education, it is difficult to definitively say whether completing his education would lead to satisfaction.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1360, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If jake considers john's example he would become the strongest and fittest person ever.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that by simply considering John's example, Jake would become the strongest and fittest person ever. This is not common sense because becoming the strongest and fittest person involves numerous factors such as genetics, consistent training, diet, lifestyle, and more. Simply considering someone's example does not guarantee that Jake would achieve the same level of fitness or strength. Therefore, the statement overlooks the complexity and individual differences involved in physical fitness and strength training. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 1361, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If jake invites people over he would forget to give them directions.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Jake invites people over he would forget to give them directions\" is not necessarily common sense, as it makes an assumption about Jake's behavior without additional context. Common sense would suggest that if someone is hosting and inviting guests, they would typically provide the necessary information to ensure their guests arrive safely and punctually. Without knowing more about Jake's habitual behavior or past incidents, it is not reasonable to conclude that he would always forget to give directions. Therefore, the statement is not a reflection of common sense, but rather a specific claim about an individual's behavior.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1362, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If jake is feeling a little cold it is because they are in the vacuum of space.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Jake is feeling a little cold it is because they are in the vacuum of space\" does not align with common sense. Feeling cold can be attributed to many everyday factors such as weather conditions, air conditioning, or inadequate clothing. The vacuum of space is an extreme and uncommon environment that most people will never experience. It is not a typical or immediate conclusion to draw when someone mentions feeling cold. Additionally, the vacuum of space itself would not make someone feel \"a little cold\" but rather would pose severe and immediate threats to human life due to lack of oxygen and atmospheric pressure.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1363, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If jake planned mary's wedding it would be a disaster and mismanaged.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Jake planned Mary's wedding it would be a disaster and mismanaged\" assumes certain qualities about Jake's organizational skills and ability to manage events without any context or evidence. It is important to consider whether there is information available about Jake's past experience in planning events or managing projects. If Jake has a history of poor organizational skills or mismanaging events, then the statement might make sense. However, if Jake is known to be competent and skilled in this area, the statement would be unfair and baseless. Without specific information about Jake's abilities, it is difficult to determine the accuracy of the statement.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1364, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If jake refuses to pay others must chip in for him.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that if Jake does not contribute financially, others must compensate for his lack. This may not always be reasonable or fair, as it assumes collective responsibility for an individual's obligations. Whether this makes sense can depend on the context or agreement among the group members involved. However, generally speaking, each individual should be responsible for their own commitments unless a prior arrangement has been made. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 1365, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If jake sees a sign they would do what the sign says.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Jake sees a sign they would do what the sign says\" implies that Jake consistently follows directions provided by signs. However, it's important to consider that people may not always follow signs depending on the context, their understanding of the sign, personal judgment, or even the legality of the directive. People have the ability to interpret and choose whether or not to comply with signs based on various factors. Therefore, assuming that Jake would unfailingly do what a sign says might not align with common human behavior which is influenced by individual discretion and situation. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 1366, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If jake stops in front of john it is possible that john could run into jake from behind.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement, \"If Jake stops in front of John it is possible that John could run into Jake from behind,\" is based on a logical sequence of events where one person stopping suddenly could lead to a collision if the person behind them is not able to stop in time. This is a common occurrence in scenarios involving movement, such as driving, biking, or walking. If Jake stops abruptly and John is close behind without enough time or space to react, a collision is indeed possible. Therefore, the statement aligns with common sense as it reflects a realistic and plausible outcome based on the described situation.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1367, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If jake uploads the video he would unplug the computer if it was a mistake.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that Jake would unplug the computer as a response to mistakenly uploading a video. Unplugging the computer, however, would not undo the upload or resolve the mistake of uploading the video, as the video would already be on the internet or the platform it was uploaded to. A more sensible response would be for Jake to delete the video from the platform or correct the mistake by other means, rather than unplugging the computer. Therefore, the statement does not align with a common-sense approach to rectifying the mistake of an unwanted video upload.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1368, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If jake wants a new looks he would shave his head.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Jake wants a new look he would shave his head\" is not necessarily common sense, as wanting a new look can be achieved through various means, not just by shaving one's head. Different people may choose different ways to change their appearance, such as changing their hairstyle, clothing, or makeup. Shaving the head is just one option among many. Therefore, the statement is not universally applicable or self-evident. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 1369, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If jake wants to write a story he should not copy and paste from the computer.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that if Jake wants to write a story, he should create original content rather than copying and pasting from the computer. This is a common sense guideline because copying and pasting someone else's work could lead to plagiarism, which is unethical and illegal. Original writing encourages creativity and helps Jake develop his own writing style and skills. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1370, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If jake wears a swimsuit he might not know how to swim.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Jake wears a swimsuit he might not know how to swim\" does not necessarily align with common sense. Wearing a swimsuit is typically associated with swimming or engaging in water activities. However, wearing a swimsuit does not inherently indicate the skill level of the individual wearing it; someone might wear a swimsuit simply to wade, sunbathe, or participate in water-related activities without swimming. Therefore, the statement does not logically follow that wearing a swimsuit implies a lack of swimming ability. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 1371, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If john affects mary's health he would offer to buy them some medicine.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement implies that John feels responsible for negatively impacting Mary's health and is willing to make amends by offering to buy medicine. This shows a sense of accountability and consideration for Mary's well-being. In many cultures, it is common for individuals to help those they have inadvertently harmed, especially in matters of health. Therefore, offering assistance such as buying medicine can be seen as a thoughtful and appropriate gesture.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1372, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If john affects mary's health he would take care of her if need be.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If John affects Mary's health he would take care of her if need be\" implies a sense of responsibility and care from John towards Mary. It suggests that if John's actions have a negative impact on Mary's health, he would feel obligated to help and support her during her recovery. This kind of moral and ethical responsibility is generally expected in close relationships, whether they are familial, romantic, or friendly. It is common for individuals to feel a sense of duty to help those they have affected negatively, especially if they have a close relationship.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1373, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If john asks a question he would listen attentively to the response.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If John asks a question he would listen attentively to the response\" suggests that John is genuinely interested in the answer, which is why he asked the question in the first place. It is common sense that someone who asks a question would want to hear and understand the response, as it would provide them with the information or clarification they are seeking. Therefore, attentive listening would be a reasonable expectation in this scenario.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1374, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If john asks jake to sit then john wanted jake to listen.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If John asks Jake to sit then John wanted Jake to listen\" suggests that John's request for Jake to sit is a precursor to wanting Jake's attention for communication. It is possible that John believes sitting will help Jake focus and be better prepared to listen. However, the statement may not always hold true as there could be other reasons for asking Jake to sit, such as simply resting or being in a specific location. The connection between sitting and listening, while plausible, is not necessarily a direct or automatic consequence. Therefore, while the statement could be reasonable in some contexts, it is not universally applicable as a common sense assumption.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1375, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If john becomes a police officer he would learn how to fire their gun better.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If John becomes a police officer he would learn how to fire their gun better\" implies that police training includes firearms training, which is generally true. Police officers are required to undergo extensive training in the use and handling of firearms to ensure they can perform their duties safely and effectively. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that if John becomes a police officer, he would receive training that would improve his skills in firing a gun. \n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1376, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If john begs mary's mom them john feels guilty.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If John begs Mary's mom then John feels guilty\" is not necessarily common sense, as it relies on specific assumptions about the emotional response of the individual, John, in this situation. Common sense would suggest that feelings of guilt depend on the context, personal values, and motivations behind the action of begging. Without knowing more about the circumstances and John's personal beliefs or relationship with Mary's mom, it's not possible to definitively say that begging would lead to guilt. Therefore, the statement does not universally hold as common sense. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 1377, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If john breaks jake's ankle he would simply continue on his way.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement implies that John would not stop or show concern for Jake after causing him harm, which suggests a lack of empathy or responsibility. In most societies, it is generally expected that individuals take responsibility for their actions and show concern for the well-being of others, especially if they have caused harm. Therefore, the statement does not reflect common sense as it goes against widely held moral and ethical values. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 1378, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If john breaks jake's foot then jake would ask why john did that.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If John breaks Jake's foot then Jake would ask why John did that\" implies that Jake would seek an explanation for John's actions, which is a typical and expected response when someone is hurt by another person. It is common for individuals to inquire about the motives behind actions that directly affect them, especially in scenarios involving harm or injury. Thus, seeking clarity and understanding in such a situation aligns with typical human behavior and social norms.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1379, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If john brings jake to the ground it would be because they are practicing tactical maneuvers.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that the reason John brings Jake to the ground is due to them practicing tactical maneuvers, which implies that they are engaging in some sort of training or exercise related to self-defense, military, or law enforcement techniques. This explanation provides a reasonable and non-violent context for the action described, making it a plausible scenario. It aligns with common sense that individuals might practice such maneuvers in a controlled environment for the purpose of skill development. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1380, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If john brings mary a spare key he will first think of which one to use.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If John brings Mary a spare key he will first think of which one to use\" is based on the assumption that John has multiple spare keys to choose from and that he needs to consider which one would be appropriate for Mary. It is common sense to consider the options available before making a decision that involves providing access to something as important as a home or vehicle. Taking a moment to think about which key to use ensures that the correct key is given and avoids potential confusion or inconvenience. \n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1381, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If john brings mary the news it is more than likely true.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that John is a reliable source of information when he brings news to Mary. However, without any further context about John's credibility or the nature of the news, it is difficult to determine if the statement is common sense. Common sense would rely on a consistent pattern of truthfulness and accuracy in John's behavior, which is not provided in the statement. Therefore, it is not necessarily common sense to assume the news is true based solely on the fact that John is the one delivering it.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1382, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If john builds a birdhouse he would hang it inside the house.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If John builds a birdhouse he would hang it inside the house\" does not align with common sense. Typically, birdhouses are built to provide shelter for birds outdoors and are hung outside where birds can easily access them. Hanging a birdhouse inside the house would defeat its purpose as birds would not be able to use it. Therefore, the statement does not reflect a common or practical approach to using a birdhouse. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 1383, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If john buys a new chair he would never even think to sit in it.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If John buys a new chair he would never even think to sit in it\" does not align with common sense. Typically, when someone purchases a chair, the primary purpose is to use it for sitting. It would be illogical for someone to buy a chair and then deliberately choose not to sit in it or even consider using it for its intended function. Therefore, the statement contradicts the general understanding of why people buy chairs.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1384, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If john calls jake's mother he would immediately hang up on her.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If John calls Jake's mother he would immediately hang up on her\" is not necessarily common sense without further context. Common sense would require understanding the relationship between John and Jake's mother, their history, and any potential reasons for such behavior. It's not a universal or self-evident truth that someone would hang up immediately just based on the individuals involved. Therefore, additional information is needed to determine if this action is reasonable or expected. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 1385, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If john calls jake's mother he would talk for awhile.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that if John calls Jake's mother, they would have a long conversation. This could imply that John and Jake's mother have a good relationship or have a lot to talk about, making it plausible that the conversation would last for a while. However, without additional context about their relationship or the nature of the call, it's not possible to definitively say that this statement is common sense. Common sense would generally rely on more universally understood and agreed-upon principles or scenarios. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 1386, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If john comes near jake jake would just not care.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that Jake is indifferent to John's presence. The statement is common sense if Jake is known to be apathetic or indifferent toward John in prior contexts or if there is no significant relationship between them. However, without context or information about their relationship, it's hard to definitively classify the statement as common sense. It depends on the personalities and history of John and Jake. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 1387, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If john comes near mary she will make awful noises.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If John comes near Mary she will make awful noises\" does not necessarily align with common sense without further context. Common sense suggests that people generally interact in a socially acceptable manner unless there is a specific reason or condition causing the reaction described. Without knowing the underlying reasons such as a fear, a medical condition, or a past negative experience involving John, it is difficult to determine if Mary's reaction is reasonable or expected. Common sense would need additional information to justify such a reaction.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1388, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If john considers the example mary suggested he will ask questions regarding this example.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement implies that John will engage in asking questions about the example suggested by Mary if he considers it. This is a reasonable assumption as it suggests that John is interested in understanding or clarifying the example further. It is common for individuals to ask questions about something they are considering or trying to understand better. Therefore, the statement aligns with typical human behavior in a learning or collaborative scenario.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1389, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If john creams in their jeans he will walk around in his pants all day.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement does not necessarily reflect common sense as it is based on a specific and unusual behavior that may not be universally applicable or logical. Common sense would suggest that if someone were to soil their clothing, they would likely change into clean clothing rather than continue wearing the soiled item. Additionally, the statement includes assumptions about an individual's behavior that may not be accurate or reasonable.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1390, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If john cries jake a river john had it coming.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If john cries jake a river john had it coming\" is somewhat ambiguous and could be interpreted in different ways. It suggests that if John's actions lead to a significant emotional response from Jake (such as crying a river), it implies that John's actions were deserving of such a reaction. However, without further context on the situation or the relationship between John and Jake, it's difficult to definitively say whether this is a common-sense statement. It relies on the assumption that any strong reaction is justified, which may not always be the case. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 1391, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If john cries jake a river something bad must have happened.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that if John is crying to such an extent that it is metaphorically described as \"crying a river,\" then it implies a significant emotional response typically triggered by a negative event or situation. This interpretation aligns with common understanding that excessive crying often correlates with distress or sadness. Therefore, it is reasonable to deduce that something bad must have happened to evoke such a strong reaction from John.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1392, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If john decided not to be friends with jake jake would feel unliked.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If John decided not to be friends with Jake, Jake would feel unliked\" suggests that Jake would feel a sense of rejection or exclusion if John no longer wanted to be friends. It is a common emotional response for someone to feel unwanted or disliked when a friend decides to end the friendship. This feeling can arise from the loss of the social connection and the perceived negative judgment from the friend who is ending the relationship. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that Jake might feel unliked if John decided not to be friends with him.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1393, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If john digs himself into a hole he will be in a bad mood.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If John digs himself into a hole he will be in a bad mood\" can be interpreted metaphorically to suggest that if John gets himself into a difficult or problematic situation, he may feel frustrated or upset as a result. This is a common emotional response when faced with challenging circumstances. Therefore, it seems reasonable to consider this statement as reflecting common sense since it aligns with typical human reactions to adversity. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1394, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If john draws a conclusion he would be taking many other people's conclusions into account.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that when John draws a conclusion, he considers the perspectives and conclusions of others, which is a common approach in decision-making and critical thinking. Taking into account multiple viewpoints can lead to a more informed and balanced conclusion, as it incorporates diverse insights and reduces the likelihood of bias. This is a sensible and effective way to approach problem-solving or decision-making, and is generally encouraged in collaborative environments.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1395, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If john draws mary close he wants to kiss her on the cheek.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If John draws Mary close he wants to kiss her on the cheek\" is not necessarily common sense because it assumes a specific intention based on an action without considering other possibilities or the context of their relationship. Drawing someone close could imply a range of intentions such as comfort, protection, or a platonic gesture, not necessarily a desire to kiss them on the cheek. Additionally, cultural and personal boundaries play a significant role in interpreting physical actions. Therefore, the statement oversimplifies human interactions and intentions. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 1396, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If john dug himself into a hole the best thing to do would be to get out of the hole not get deeper in.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement is essentially a metaphor for addressing a problematic situation. The idea is that when one finds themselves in a difficult or unfavorable position, the logical approach would be to work towards resolving or improving the situation rather than exacerbating it. Continuing to \"dig deeper\" would only make the situation more challenging and harder to escape from. Therefore, it is common sense to try to \"get out of the hole\" rather than making it worse. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1397, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If john enforces his rights he would do it poorly.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If John enforces his rights he would do it poorly\" is not necessarily a matter of common sense, as it involves making an assumption about John's abilities without any specific context or evidence. Common sense typically relies on general knowledge or practical judgment, but this statement seems to be more of a subjective opinion about an individual's capability. Without further information about John's skills, experience, or the specific situation in which he is enforcing his rights, it is difficult to determine the accuracy or fairness of the statement. \n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1398, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If john enforces his rights it would be out of line because he does not have the authority to do so.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that John enforcing his rights would be inappropriate because he lacks the authority. It is important to consider what type of rights and authority are being discussed. If the rights in question are personal or legal rights that everyone inherently possesses, then John would not need additional authority to enforce them. However, if the rights pertain to a specific role or position that requires certain authority, and John does not possess that authority, then enforcing those rights would indeed be out of line. Thus, the applicability of the statement depends on the context of the rights and authority mentioned. \n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1399, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If john explained his reasons it would make sense.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If John explained his reasons it would make sense\" implies that understanding John's reasons would provide clarity or justification for his actions or decisions. This is a common assumption that explanations can lead to better understanding. It is based on the idea that communication can help resolve confusion or misunderstanding. Therefore, the statement reflects a common sense approach to resolving uncertainty by seeking more information. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1400, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If john feeds the fish he would do so from a distance.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If John feeds the fish he would do so from a distance\" may not necessarily be common sense, as it depends on various factors such as the type of fish, their environment, and John's personal preferences or safety concerns. Generally, feeding fish does not require maintaining a distance unless the fish are large, potentially dangerous, or if the feeding method requires it (such as throwing food into a large pond or tank). Without additional context suggesting a specific reason for distance, this statement does not align with typical fish-feeding practices. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 1401, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If john fills mary's glass john would wait for the glass to overflow as he would be pouring so that mary could enjoy the greatest amount of the beverage as possible.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement does not reflect common sense. Common sense would suggest that pouring a beverage until the glass overflows is impractical and wasteful, as it creates a mess and results in less beverage for Mary to enjoy. A sensible approach would be to fill the glass to an appropriate level, ensuring that Mary can enjoy the beverage without any spillage. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 1402, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If john finds a book to read he would find a quiet place to read it.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If John finds a book to read he would find a quiet place to read it\" is based on the assumption that John prefers a quiet environment to focus and enjoy his reading. This is a common preference among many people, as a quiet place typically allows for better concentration and minimizes distractions. Therefore, it makes sense that John would seek out a quiet spot to read his book in peace. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1403, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If john gave mary flowers he would expect her to like them.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If John gave Mary flowers he would expect her to like them\" is based on the general understanding that giving flowers is a gesture of goodwill and affection. It is common for someone who gives a gift to expect that the recipient will appreciate and enjoy it, especially when it is a thoughtful and traditional gift like flowers. This expectation is rooted in social norms and the general intention behind gift-giving, which is to make the recipient happy.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1404, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If john gets a second job he would start slacking off at both his first and second job assuming neither of the jobs will fire him.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement assumes that taking on a second job would lead to decreased performance in both jobs due to potentially increased fatigue, stress, and divided attention. It is a common assumption that managing multiple responsibilities can stretch a person's capacity and impact their effectiveness. However, this is not universally true as individual capabilities, time management skills, and job demands vary greatly. Some people may thrive and maintain high performance in both jobs. Therefore, the statement is not necessarily common sense as it does not account for individual differences and circumstances.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1405, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If john gets an award then he feels happy.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If John gets an award then he feels happy\" seems to rely on a common understanding that receiving recognition or an award generally leads to positive emotions like happiness. Receiving an award typically signifies achievement, success, or validation of one's efforts, which are common reasons for individuals to feel happy. Therefore, it's reasonable to assume that John, like many others, would feel happy when he receives an award.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1406, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If john gets back home he would stay outside.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If John gets back home he would stay outside\" seems contradictory because typically when someone gets back home, they would go inside their residence. The statement does not provide any additional context or reasoning for why John would stay outside instead of going inside, which makes it difficult to consider it as common sense. \n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1407, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If john gets back home it's just a part of his routine.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If John gets back home it's just a part of his routine\" suggests that returning home is a regular and expected behavior for John, which is typical for most people as they usually have a place of residence to return to daily. This can be considered common sense because it aligns with the general understanding of daily human habits and routines. \n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1408, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If john gets fed up he may talk it out with everyone.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that if John becomes frustrated or overwhelmed, he might choose to discuss his feelings with others as a way of coping or finding solutions. This is a common approach that many people take when dealing with emotional stress or challenges, as talking things through can provide support, different perspectives, and potential solutions. Therefore, the idea that someone might talk about their problems when they are fed up aligns with typical human behavior in managing emotions and seeking help. \n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1409, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If john gets on a crowded train he would sit on top of another passenger.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If John gets on a crowded train he would sit on top of another passenger\" does not align with common sense or social norms. In crowded public transportation settings, it is customary for passengers to find available seats or stand if no seats are available. Sitting on top of another passenger would be considered inappropriate and disrespectful behavior. Therefore, the statement does not represent a common or sensible action.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1410, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If john gets on a crowded train he would try and share the seat with someone.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If John gets on a crowded train he would try and share the seat with someone\" is based on an assumption about John's behavior in a specific situation, which may not be universally applicable. Whether or not John would try to share a seat depends on various factors such as his personality, cultural norms, and the specific circumstances on the train. Without further information about John or the context, it is difficult to determine if this is a common-sense statement. Therefore, the statement cannot be assumed to be common sense as it relies on subjective factors.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1411, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If john gets on a crowded train it would not be cramped.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If John gets on a crowded train it would not be cramped\" does not align with common sense. Generally, a crowded train implies a lack of space and a cramped environment due to the high number of passengers. Adding another person, such as John, would typically increase the cramped feeling rather than alleviate it. Therefore, the statement contradicts the typical understanding of what happens when more people board an already crowded train. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 1412, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If john gets the letter he would throw it in the trash without even looking at it.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that John has a strong negative reaction to receiving the letter, possibly due to its sender or content. Without additional context about John's feelings or past experiences with similar letters, it's difficult to determine if this reaction is common sense. Common sense typically involves practical and sound judgment, and discarding a letter without looking at it might be seen as irrational or hasty unless there are specific reasons for such behavior.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1413, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If john gives jake an ultimatum then jake would listen to john.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If John gives Jake an ultimatum then Jake would listen to John\" is not necessarily common sense. Common sense would suggest that the reaction to an ultimatum depends on the relationship between the individuals, the nature of the ultimatum, and the personalities of those involved. Without knowing the specifics of their relationship or the context of the ultimatum, it is not possible to predict with certainty that Jake would listen to John. An ultimatum can sometimes lead to resistance or defiance instead of compliance. Therefore, the statement cannot be accepted as common sense without additional information.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1414, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If john gives jake one jake would assume there are more.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If John gives Jake one, Jake would assume there are more\" implies that Jake might infer the existence of additional items based on receiving one from John. This could be considered common sense if we assume that people often expect that someone who gives away an item might possess more of the same item. However, this assumption is not universally true as it depends on the context and the nature of the item being given. Without further information about what is being given and the circumstances, it is not possible to definitively say that it is common sense for Jake to assume there are more. Therefore, the assumption might be intuitive in some cases, but it is not a universal rule.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1415, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If john goes to play then he wants to begin a match.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If John goes to play then he wants to begin a match\" suggests a direct correlation between John's decision to play and his desire to start a match. This implies that John's intention for playing is competitive or structured in nature. However, it is not necessarily common sense to assume this, as people play for various reasons such as leisure, exercise, or social interaction, which may not involve starting a match. The desire to start a match is specific and may not apply to every scenario where John goes to play.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1416, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If john hangs around jake john would say something that offends jake.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If John hangs around Jake, John would say something that offends Jake\" assumes a specific dynamic between John and Jake wherein John is likely to say something offensive. Without further context or evidence of their relationship and communication patterns, it is not possible to determine if this statement is common sense. Common sense typically relies on general knowledge or widely observed behaviors, neither of which can be confirmed from this statement alone. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 1417, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If john harms mary's health he will stop doing whatever harms her and will apologize.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement assumes that John has the awareness and willingness to acknowledge that his actions are causing harm to Mary's health, and that he will take responsibility by stopping those actions and apologizing. This scenario implies a level of empathy and moral responsibility on John's part. However, it is not guaranteed that all individuals will react in this manner when their actions negatively impact someone else, as people's responses can vary based on their personality, values, and circumstances. Therefore, while the statement reflects an ideal and considerate behavior, it cannot be universally expected as common sense.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1418, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If john has a great boss he can jump on his boss's desk.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If John has a great boss he can jump on his boss's desk\" does not align with common sense. Having a great boss typically implies a positive and respectful working relationship, but it does not justify or excuse unprofessional behavior such as jumping on a desk. Such actions could be seen as disrespectful and inappropriate in a professional environment, regardless of the quality of the relationship between employee and boss.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1419, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If john has a great boss he might want to find a different supervisor.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If John has a great boss he might want to find a different supervisor\" does not align with common sense. Generally, if an employee has a great boss, they would likely be satisfied and motivated in their current position, appreciating the positive work environment and effective leadership. There would be little reason for them to seek a change in supervision if their current boss is providing great support and management. Therefore, the statement contradicts typical reasoning in a workplace context. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 1420, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If john has a high fever all he needs to do is to wait for the fever to subside.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement, \"If John has a high fever all he needs to do is to wait for the fever to subside,\" may not be common sense because a high fever could be a symptom of a more serious underlying condition that may require medical attention. Simply waiting for the fever to subside without addressing the root cause or monitoring for other symptoms could potentially be harmful. Additionally, if the fever is very high, it might require interventions like fever-reducing medications or other treatments to prevent complications. Therefore, it is important to consider other factors and possibly seek medical advice rather than just waiting. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 1421, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If john has an english test tomorrow he would review the material for the exam.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If John has an English test tomorrow, he would review the material for the exam\" reflects a common sense approach to preparing for an assessment. Generally, individuals who have an upcoming test will review the relevant material to improve their understanding and performance. Reviewing material is a typical and practical strategy to enhance one's readiness and confidence for an exam. Therefore, the statement aligns with a logical and widely accepted approach to test preparation.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1422, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If john is able to escape the guards will be told.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If John is able to escape, the guards will be told\" suggests a logical response to a security breach. In a situation where a person is being guarded, it would be typical protocol for the guards to be informed if the person escapes, so they can take necessary actions to recapture the individual or mitigate any further risk. This aligns with standard security procedures and practices to ensure safety and containment.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1423, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If john is cool then john is happy.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If John is cool then John is happy\" sets up a conditional relationship between being cool and being happy for John. However, being \"cool\" is a subjective term and may not necessarily correlate with happiness for everyone. Happiness can be influenced by a variety of factors such as personal relationships, mental health, and life satisfaction, which do not always relate to how \"cool\" someone appears. Therefore, the statement may not always hold true as a common-sense assumption.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1424, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If john is feeling a bit cold he might have worn too much clothing.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If John is feeling a bit cold he might have worn too much clothing\" does not align with common sense. Typically, wearing too much clothing is associated with feeling overly warm or hot, not cold. When someone feels cold, it usually suggests that they are not wearing enough clothing to keep themselves adequately insulated against the cold environment. Therefore, the logic in the statement is flawed. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 1425, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If john is feeling a bit hot he should put on more clothing.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If John is feeling a bit hot he should put on more clothing\" is not aligned with common sense. Typically, when a person feels hot, the sensible action would be to remove layers of clothing or wear lighter clothing to help cool down. Adding more clothing would likely increase body temperature further, causing discomfort. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 1426, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If john is feeling a little cold he would drink ice water.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If John is feeling a little cold he would drink ice water\" does not align with common sense reasoning. Typically, when someone is feeling cold, they would seek to warm themselves up rather than consume something cold like ice water. Drinking ice water would likely exacerbate the feeling of coldness rather than alleviate it. A more common response would be to drink something warm, like tea or coffee, or to wear warmer clothing. \n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1427, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If john is feeling a little hot and tired then it is because of his hormones regulating him.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that John's feelings of being hot and tired are directly caused by his hormones. While it's true that hormones can influence bodily functions and sensations, including temperature regulation and energy levels, there are many other potential factors that could contribute to John feeling hot and tired. These could include external factors such as the environment (e.g. hot weather), physical activity, or lack of sleep, among others. Without more information, it's not accurate to definitively attribute these feelings solely to hormonal regulation. Therefore, the statement may oversimplify the complexity of human physiology. \n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1428, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If john is feeling a little hot he should leave the freezer open to help it cool down.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "Leaving the freezer open to cool down a room is not an efficient or practical solution. Refrigerators and freezers are designed to keep the inside cold by removing heat from the air within and expelling it outside the unit. When the freezer door is left open, it causes the appliance to work harder to maintain its internal temperature, which can lead to increased energy consumption and wear on the appliance. Additionally, the amount of cold air that escapes from the freezer is unlikely to significantly impact the temperature of the room. It is more effective to use other cooling methods, such as fans or air conditioning, to cool down a room. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 1429, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If john is in trouble he will cry and give up.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If John is in trouble he will cry and give up\" is not necessarily common sense, as it makes specific assumptions about John's behavior without considering individual differences in coping mechanisms. People react to trouble in various ways, and while some might cry and give up, others might seek help, problem-solve, or face the challenge head-on. Therefore, generalizing one specific reaction to trouble as common sense is not accurate, as it does not account for the diversity in human behavior.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1430, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If john is leaving a fast food store with a bag it contains only condiments.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If John is leaving a fast food store with a bag it contains only condiments\" is not common sense. Typically, when people leave a fast food store with a bag, it is expected to contain food items such as burgers, fries, or other menu items along with any condiments they might have requested. It is uncommon and unlikely for a bag from a fast food store to contain only condiments, as condiments are usually supplementary to the main food items. Therefore, the statement does not align with typical expectations or general experiences at fast food establishments. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 1431, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If john is the best gift mary had ever gotten then mary has no concept of what a present truly is.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement implies that if John, a person, is considered the best gift Mary has ever received, then Mary lacks understanding of what a typical present or gift is, as gifts are usually tangible objects rather than people. The assertion suggests that Mary's perspective on gifts deviates from the conventional understanding of what a present is. However, the statement could also be interpreted as dismissive of the idea that someone's presence or relationship can be the most valuable gift, which is a subjective and personal sentiment. Therefore, the statement's validity depends on one's interpretation of what constitutes a \"true\" gift, making it not necessarily a matter of common sense, which relies on widely accepted and objective reasoning. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 1432, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If john is wearing a swimsuit then he is going to work.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If John is wearing a swimsuit then he is going to work\" does not align with common sense in typical work environments, as swimsuits are generally not considered appropriate work attire. Swimsuits are usually worn for swimming or activities related to water, such as going to the beach or a pool. Most workplaces have dress codes that require more formal or professional clothing. Unless John's job specifically involves water activities, such as being a lifeguard or swim instructor, this statement would not be considered common sense. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 1433, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If john joins mary's band he would not be a good fit because he doesn't sing or play an instrument.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement is based on the premise that to be a good fit in a band, one should either sing or play an instrument, which are the primary roles in a band. If John does neither, it logically follows that he would not contribute effectively to the band's performance and overall goals. This reasoning aligns with common understanding of what skills are necessary to participate in a musical group.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1434, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If john laughs about someone else it is possible john is sad.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that when John laughs about someone else, it could be a coping mechanism or a way to mask his own sadness. It is a common psychological behavior for individuals to use humor as a way to deflect their own negative emotions or to temporarily distract themselves from their own issues. Therefore, it is reasonable to consider that John's laughter in such a context might indicate underlying sadness.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1435, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If john listens to mary's stories then john gives feedback.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If John listens to Mary's stories then John gives feedback\" is based on the idea that when someone actively listens to another person's narrative, it is common for them to respond or provide input. Listening usually implies engagement, and giving feedback is a natural way to engage in a conversation or storytelling situation. Feedback could be in the form of questions, comments, or even non-verbal responses. This kind of interaction is typical in effective communication. \n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1436, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If john loses all his money he would leave the casino and go home.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If John loses all his money he would leave the casino and go home\" suggests that once John has no more money to gamble with, he has a practical reason to leave the casino. It is common for individuals to stop participating in activities like gambling when they no longer have the resources to continue. Additionally, going home could be seen as a natural next step after leaving the casino, especially if there is no further reason to stay. Therefore, the statement aligns with typical rational behavior in such a situation.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1437, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If john loses all of his money he would lie and run away from the situation.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If John loses all of his money he would lie and run away from the situation\" is not necessarily common sense, as it makes assumptions about John's character and behavior without any context or evidence. Common sense would suggest that different individuals may react differently to financial loss, and their responses could be influenced by a variety of factors such as personality, values, and circumstances. Therefore, it is not reasonable to generalize this specific reaction to all cases of financial loss. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 1438, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If john makes a impression on mary he always assumes mary is impressed.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If John makes an impression on Mary, he always assumes Mary is impressed\" suggests that John may be overconfident or prone to assuming that his actions have the desired effect on Mary, regardless of her actual feelings. It is not necessarily common sense, as common sense would dictate considering feedback or cues from Mary to determine whether she is actually impressed. Assuming someone's feelings or reactions without clear evidence can lead to misunderstandings or incorrect assumptions.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1439, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If john makes an impression on jake it would be a good one because jake was polite and did not act like a fool.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that because Jake was polite and did not act foolishly, it would lead to John having a good impression of him. This is based on the general idea that polite and respectful behavior tends to be viewed positively by others. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that Jake's behavior would contribute to a favorable impression on John. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1440, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If john makes mary money he would not give her the money.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If John makes Mary money, he would not give her the money\" implies that John, despite being responsible for generating money for Mary, would not actually provide her with the money he made for her. This suggests a lack of trustworthiness or fairness on John's part. Common sense would suggest that if someone makes money on behalf of another person, they should rightfully give that money to the person it was made for. Therefore, the statement contradicts common sense expectations of fairness and honesty in handling financial matters for others. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 1441, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If john makes sure it is perfect then it is perfect.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If John makes sure it is perfect then it is perfect\" is contingent upon the subjective interpretation of \"perfect\" and the capability or reliability of John in ensuring perfection. The statement assumes that John's standards and execution align perfectly with the universally accepted standards of perfection, which may not always be the case. Different people have different interpretations of what \"perfect\" means, and even if John is meticulous, his idea of perfect may differ from others. Therefore, the statement cannot be universally accepted as common sense as it relies heavily on individual judgment and subjective standards. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 1442, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If john marries jake's sister john would become closer to jake.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If John marries Jake's sister, John would become closer to Jake\" suggests that the marriage would create a familial bond between John and Jake, as John would become Jake's brother-in-law. This new relationship could potentially strengthen their personal connection and make them more involved in each other's lives through family gatherings and shared experiences. It is common for in-laws to develop closer relationships after marriage within the family. Therefore, the statement is based on the idea that family ties can bring people closer together.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1443, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If john marries mary's sister it would be a disaster because her sister is already married.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement is based on the premise that marrying someone who is already married would create complications and potential legal and ethical issues, as it would involve engaging in bigamy, which is illegal and socially unacceptable in most societies. Additionally, it could lead to emotional distress for all parties involved. Given this understanding, the statement aligns with common sense as it acknowledges the potential negative consequences of such an action.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1444, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If john marries mary's sister john will never talk to mary.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If John marries Mary's sister, John will never talk to Mary\" does not necessarily align with common sense. Common sense would suggest that familial relationships, such as in-laws, can coexist and communicate effectively, regardless of who marries whom. Relationships are complex and can vary greatly, but the blanket statement that John will never talk to Mary simply because he marries her sister does not consider the potential for healthy and positive interactions between family members. Therefore, the statement lacks a logical basis and assumes an unreasonable outcome without considering the individual dynamics of the relationships involved.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1445, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If john meets mary's friend he would ask who they are and where they come from.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that John would inquire about the identity and origin of Mary's friend upon meeting them. This could be a common reaction as it is a natural and polite way to engage in conversation and get to know someone new, especially if introduced through a mutual acquaintance. However, whether or not this is common sense can depend on the social norms and context of the situation. Some people might consider it more appropriate to wait for Mary to introduce her friend and provide that information, rather than directly asking. Therefore, the statement might not necessarily be considered common sense in all situations.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1446, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If john offers mary a ride he should follow the map and not his own sense of direction.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that John should follow a map rather than relying on his own sense of direction when offering Mary a ride. This advice is based on the assumption that using a map is more reliable and accurate for navigation, reducing the likelihood of getting lost and ensuring a timely arrival at the destination. This can be particularly important if John is unfamiliar with the area or if there are specific route requirements. Following a map can help avoid confusion and misunderstandings between John and Mary about the route to be taken. Therefore, considering the potential benefits of using a map for accurate navigation, the statement can be seen as common sense. \n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1447, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If john plays darts then he intends to practice a hobby.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If John plays darts then he intends to practice a hobby\" makes sense because playing darts is generally considered a hobby. Engaging in hobbies typically involves intentional participation in activities that one enjoys or finds interesting. If John chooses to play darts, it can be inferred that he is doing so with the intention of engaging in a leisure activity or hobby. Thus, the statement aligns with common understanding of what constitutes a hobby and the intention behind participating in one. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1448, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If john pulls mary away mary will assume she is being attacked.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If John pulls Mary away, Mary will assume she is being attacked\" implies that Mary might interpret being physically pulled as a threatening or aggressive act, which could lead her to believe she is being attacked. This interpretation depends on the context, such as the relationship between John and Mary, the environment they are in, and Mary's previous experiences. Without additional information, it is difficult to definitively say that Mary will assume she is being attacked just because John pulls her away. It is possible that she might understand the action differently if she trusts John or if there is a clear reason for him to pull her away, such as to protect her from danger.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1449, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If john pushes mary away he would walk away without apologizing.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that if John pushes Mary away, he would walk away without apologizing, implying a lack of remorse or consideration for Mary's feelings. This behavior is not a given and can vary widely depending on John's personality, values, and the specific circumstances of the situation. It is not necessarily common sense to assume that someone would behave in this way as people's reactions can differ greatly. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 1450, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If john puts mary on trial he would allow mary to give her point of view of the situation.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that John, in putting Mary on trial, would allow her to present her perspective on the situation. In a fair and just legal process, it is a fundamental principle that all parties involved have the opportunity to present their side of the story. This is essential to ensure that the trial is balanced and that the decision is made based on a comprehensive understanding of the situation. Therefore, it is common sense to expect that Mary would be given the chance to give her point of view if John were to put her on trial. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1451, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If john reaches his climax he has ended it.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If John reaches his climax he has ended it\" seems to imply that reaching a climax is synonymous with ending something. This could make sense in certain contexts, such as in a narrative or story where the climax is the highest point of tension or action, after which the resolution follows and the story concludes. However, the word \"climax\" can also refer to other peak moments or turning points in various situations, not necessarily signifying an end. Without additional context, it's not clear whether reaching a climax always means something has ended. Therefore, the statement may not be universally applicable as common sense. \n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1452, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If john redoes his bedroom he would pick colors that don't blend well and buy foolish things for decorations.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement provided is not necessarily common sense, as it is subjective and based on personal opinions or assumptions about John's taste in interior design. Common sense typically refers to sound practical judgment that is generally accepted by a majority. In this case, the statement reflects a bias or personal judgment that may not be universally agreed upon. Therefore, it is not a reflection of common sense.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1453, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If john rents mary an apartment she would have to replace most of the fixtures and floors.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that the apartment requires significant repairs or updates, particularly to the fixtures and floors. This implies that the current state of the apartment may not be satisfactory for Mary's needs or preferences. It is common sense that a tenant may need to make improvements to a rented property if it does not meet their standards or if the landlord has not maintained it well. Therefore, the statement reflects a plausible scenario in the context of renting properties.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1454, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If john rents mary's apartment he would shut the windows when it's raining so water does not ruin the floor.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement reflects a common-sense approach to preventing water damage in an apartment. By closing the windows during rain, John would be taking a practical and responsible action to protect the property and maintain its condition. This is a reasonable and expected behavior for someone renting an apartment, as it helps avoid potential issues caused by water entering the space. Therefore, the statement aligns with general expectations and practical reasoning in everyday life situations.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1455, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If john runs as fast as jake then john can never beat jake in a race.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If John runs as fast as Jake then John can never beat Jake in a race\" suggests that if both runners have equal speed, there can be no variation in the outcome of the race. However, this overlooks other factors that could influence the result of a race, such as endurance, strategy, reaction time at the start, and external conditions like weather or track differences. Even with the same top speed, these factors could allow John to potentially win against Jake. Thus, the statement doesn't necessarily hold as an absolute truth. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 1456, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If john runs as fast as mary could john would still lose the race.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement implies that even if John runs at his maximum speed, which is equal to Mary's maximum speed, he would still not win the race. This suggests that there are other factors contributing to the outcome of the race, such as endurance, strategy, or perhaps a head start for Mary. The statement is not necessarily common sense, as it requires additional context to fully understand why John would still lose despite running as fast as Mary. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 1457, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If john shows mary respect he would make bizarre faces while doing so.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If John shows Mary respect he would make bizarre faces while doing so\" does not align with common sense. Typically, showing respect involves displaying courteous and considerate behavior, which would not typically include making bizarre faces as it could be perceived as mocking or disrespectful. Making bizarre faces could contradict the intention of showing respect and might be interpreted as inappropriate or offensive.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1458, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If john spends most of his time with mary they are enjoying their time.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If John spends most of his time with Mary, they are enjoying their time\" assumes that spending a lot of time together is an indicator of enjoyment. However, this assumption might not always hold true. There could be various reasons why John spends a lot of time with Mary, such as work obligations, shared responsibilities, or other external factors that do not necessarily involve enjoyment. Enjoyment is a subjective feeling and cannot be solely determined by the amount of time spent together. Therefore, the statement oversimplifies the complexity of human relationships and emotions.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1459, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If john starts exercising he would lose weight.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If John starts exercising, he would lose weight\" is generally considered to be common sense because exercise is widely recognized as a method of burning calories and increasing metabolism, which can lead to weight loss. However, the effectiveness of exercise for weight loss can depend on various factors such as the type, duration, and intensity of the exercise, as well as John's diet, lifestyle, and individual metabolism. Nonetheless, in a broad sense, the idea that exercise can contribute to weight loss aligns with common understanding and scientific evidence. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1460, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If john starts his new job he would earn a living.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If John starts his new job he would earn a living\" is based on the general understanding that having a job provides a source of income, which in turn allows a person to support themselves financially. It is common sense to assume that starting a job would lead to earning a living, as this is typically the primary purpose of employment. Therefore, the statement aligns with a widely accepted and logical assumption about the relationship between employment and financial stability. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1461, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If john starts his new job hewouldn't do the things that were expected of that job.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement, \"If John starts his new job he wouldn't do the things that were expected of that job,\" implies that John would not fulfill his job responsibilities, which is not a logical assumption to make without additional context about John's work ethic, abilities, or intentions. Common sense suggests that when someone starts a new job, they generally intend to perform the duties required of them to the best of their ability. Therefore, the statement contradicts the typical expectations one would have when starting a new job. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 1462, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If john surprises mary with tickets then mary would be happy and excited about their date.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If John surprises Mary with tickets then Mary would be happy and excited about their date\" is based on the assumption that Mary enjoys surprises and likes the event for which John got tickets. Generally, people feel positive emotions such as happiness and excitement when they receive thoughtful surprises, especially if it involves something they enjoy or have interest in. Therefore, it is reasonable to infer that Mary would react positively to John's surprise.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1463, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If john takes a breather he would run to work.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If John takes a breather he would run to work\" seems illogical and counterintuitive. Generally, taking a breather implies resting or pausing to catch one's breath, which contradicts the idea of engaging in a physically demanding activity like running immediately afterward. The statement does not align with common sense as the actions described contradict each other in terms of their physical demands. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 1464, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If john takes advantage of mary it is because he loves and respects her.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If John takes advantage of Mary it is because he loves and respects her\" is not reflective of common sense. Taking advantage of someone typically involves exploiting or manipulating them for personal gain, which contradicts the principles of love and respect. Love and respect involve caring for the well-being and dignity of the other person, not using them for one's own benefit. Therefore, the statement is illogical and contradictory in its claim.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1465, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If john takes jake's allowance he would squander it.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that if John were to take Jake's allowance, he would squander it, implying that John may not be responsible with money or may not value it as much as Jake does. However, without specific information about John's spending habits or financial responsibility, it's difficult to definitively say that this would be the case. The statement relies on an assumption about John's behavior, which may not necessarily be true. Therefore, it is not necessarily common sense, as it is based on an unsubstantiated assumption about an individual's behavior.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1466, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If john takes jake's family hostage jake will call the police.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement reflects a common reaction to a dangerous and illegal situation. If someone's family is taken hostage, it is a natural response to seek help from law enforcement to ensure their safety and resolve the situation. Calling the police would be a reasonable and expected course of action in such a scenario. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1467, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If john takes jake's flu shot he would inform someone immediately of the situation.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If John takes Jake's flu shot he would inform someone immediately of the situation\" suggests a sense of responsibility and urgency in communicating about a potentially serious mistake involving medication. It is common sense to promptly address and rectify such errors to prevent possible health consequences for the individuals involved. Communication is key in healthcare settings to ensure proper treatment and patient safety. Therefore, it is reasonable to expect someone to inform the relevant parties if a mix-up like taking someone else's flu shot occurs.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1468, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If john takes mary's advice then john needs to receive advice from mary.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If John takes Mary's advice then John needs to receive advice from Mary\" suggests a logical sequence where the reception of advice precedes acting on it. In order for John to take Mary's advice, he must first have received it. It is a prerequisite that John has access to the advice before he can choose to follow it. This is a basic requirement in the sequence of events and aligns with common sense understanding of how advice is given and taken. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1469, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If john takes some medicine he would feel better in a few hours.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If John takes some medicine he would feel better in a few hours\" is based on the assumption that the medicine is appropriate for his symptoms and is effective in treating his condition. In many cases, taking the right medication can help alleviate symptoms and promote healing, leading to an improvement in how one feels. However, the effectiveness of the medicine and the time it takes to work can vary depending on factors such as the type of illness, the specific medication, and the individual's body response. Therefore, while the statement could be true in many situations, it is not universally applicable without knowing more specific details about John's condition and the medicine. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 1470, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If john takes the car he would not drive it into a lake because he is paying attention.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that John, by paying attention while driving, would avoid driving the car into a lake. This is a reasonable assumption as paying attention while driving generally helps prevent accidents and reckless decisions. Therefore, it follows common sense to assume that someone who is attentive and cautious would not drive into a lake intentionally or accidentally.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1471, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If john takes the trash out he may put it in the recycling bin instead.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If John takes the trash out he may put it in the recycling bin instead\" suggests that there is a possibility that John might mix up the trash with recycling, or that he might intentionally choose to put trash in the recycling bin. This could be due to lack of knowledge about proper waste disposal, carelessness, or a misunderstanding of what items belong in the recycling bin. It is not necessarily common sense, as common sense would dictate that trash and recycling should be properly sorted and disposed of in their respective bins. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 1472, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If john talks about jake's relationship then jake wants tell jake about what john said.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that if John discusses Jake's relationship, Jake would want to inform himself about what John said. This appears to be a mistake in the statement, as it seems more logical that Jake would want to inform someone else (potentially a third party or John himself) about John's discussion, rather than telling himself. Based on the confusion and likely error in the phrasing of the statement, it does not align with common sense. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 1473, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If john talks to mary's mother they would have a conversation about it.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If John talks to Mary's mother they would have a conversation about it\" suggests that if John engages in communication with Mary's mother, the topic of their conversation would be the subject of \"it,\" presumably something previously mentioned or known to both parties. This is a logical assumption since conversations generally revolve around topics that are relevant or of interest to the participants. Therefore, it is common sense to expect that if John talks to Mary's mother, they would discuss the matter at hand.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1474, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If john tells mary anything then john will speak at a normal rate.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If John tells Mary anything then John will speak at a normal rate\" assumes a direct correlation between John telling Mary something and the rate at which he speaks. However, the rate at which someone speaks can be influenced by various factors such as emotions, the context of the conversation, or individual speaking habits. This statement does not account for these variables and assumes a consistent behavior that may not necessarily be true in all situations. \n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1475, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If john tells mary that he has flu mary will maintain distance and take other precautions like vaccination.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement reflects common sense as it involves taking preventive measures to avoid contracting an illness, which is a typical response when someone learns that another person is contagious. Maintaining distance and considering vaccination are logical steps to minimize the risk of getting infected with the flu. Therefore, Mary's actions align with general health guidelines and recommendations for preventing the spread of infectious diseases.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1476, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If john texts mary back he would patiently await a response.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that if John texts Mary back, he will wait for her response patiently. This behavior is generally expected in a texting conversation, as it is polite and respectful to allow the other person time to reply. Waiting for a response after sending a text is a common practice in communication etiquette. Therefore, the statement aligns with typical expectations in a texting interaction.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1477, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If john throws jake a surprise birthday party john only considers what he she thinks is a fun time.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement implies that John is organizing the surprise birthday party with only his own preferences in mind, not taking into consideration what Jake might enjoy. This could be seen as inconsiderate, as the party is meant to celebrate Jake and should ideally cater to his interests and preferences. However, the statement is a generalization and does not necessarily hold true for all situations, as it assumes John's intentions without further context. Therefore, it may not be common sense to assume that John is only considering his own idea of fun without considering Jake's preferences.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1478, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If john throws mary a surprise party he will invite too many people.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If John throws Mary a surprise party he will invite too many people\" is not necessarily common sense because it relies on assumptions about John's behavior and judgment that may not be universally true. Common sense would suggest that the number of people John invites would depend on various factors such as the size of the venue, Mary's preferences, and John's knowledge of their mutual friends. Without specific information about John's past behavior or tendencies in party planning, it's not reasonable to assume he will invite too many people as a general rule. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 1479, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If john throws mary a surprise party he will keep it a surprise.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If John throws Mary a surprise party he will keep it a surprise\" is based on the very definition of a \"surprise party,\" which is meant to be an unexpected event that the guest of honor does not know about beforehand. By saying that John will keep it a surprise, it implies that he will not reveal any details about the party to Mary in order to maintain the element of surprise. Therefore, the statement aligns with the common understanding of what a surprise party entails and the necessary actions (keeping it secret) to achieve that. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1480, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If john turns jake away john would do so in a convivial respectful manner.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement assumes that John has a specific personality trait of being convivial and respectful when rejecting someone. Without further context or knowledge about John's behavior or character, it is difficult to determine if this statement aligns with common sense. Common sense would suggest that individuals can react differently in various situations, and their responses can be influenced by multiple factors such as their mood, relationship with the other person, or the circumstances leading to the decision. Therefore, assuming that John would always behave in a convivial and respectful manner when turning someone away may not be a common-sense conclusion without additional information about John's consistent behavior.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1481, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If john turns jake's music down then jake would get stressed.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If John turns Jake's music down then Jake would get stressed\" is not necessarily common sense because it assumes a specific reaction from Jake without considering individual differences in how people respond to changes in their environment. The statement presupposes that Jake relies on the music at a certain volume for relaxation or focus, but that may not be true for everyone. It's possible that Jake could be indifferent or even relieved by the music being turned down. Therefore, the assumption that turning the music down would universally cause stress is not a common-sense conclusion without additional context about Jake's preferences or needs.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1482, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If john uploads a video by mistake he will delete it.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If John uploads a video by mistake he will delete it\" is based on the idea that individuals generally want to correct their mistakes, especially when it comes to public content like videos. Deleting a mistakenly uploaded video helps prevent any unintended consequences or misunderstandings that could arise from the content being publicly accessible. Therefore, it is logical and reasonable to assume that someone would take action to rectify the error by removing the video. \n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1483, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If john uploads he would take off right after.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If John uploads, he would take off right after\" implies that there is a cause-and-effect relationship between John uploading something and him leaving immediately afterward. This relationship is not a common sense assumption, as uploading something does not necessarily lead to someone leaving right after. The statement may be specific to a particular context or situation that is not universally understood or applicable. Without additional information about the circumstances, it cannot be considered common sense. \n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1484, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If john uploads the video he would forget to publish it.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If John uploads the video he would forget to publish it\" is not necessarily a matter of common sense, as it involves making an assumption about John's behavior without any context or evidence. Common sense typically involves practical and sound judgment based on a simple perception of the situation or facts. The statement is more of a prediction that may or may not be accurate, depending on John's habits, attention to detail, or other external factors. Therefore, it is not a universal truth or a logical conclusion derived from common sense.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1485, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If john wants a new look he will consider his own sense of style before considering what is trendy.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that John prioritizes his personal preferences and sense of style over following current fashion trends when considering a new look. This approach is generally seen as practical and self-aware, as it emphasizes individuality and comfort with one's own choices rather than conforming to external influences. It is common for people to value their unique style as it reflects their personality and tastes, which are more constant compared to the ever-changing nature of trends. Therefore, this statement aligns with a common-sense approach to making style decisions based on personal preference. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1486, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If john wants someone to take their trash out it is because he is too lazy to do it himself.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement makes an assumption about John's motives without considering other potential reasons for his request. It's possible that John is physically unable to take out the trash, has other responsibilities at the time, or simply wants to delegate tasks in a shared living situation. Without further context about John's circumstances or reasons, it's unfair to immediately attribute his request to laziness. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 1487, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If john wants to be a teacher he would apply for a teaching position.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If John wants to be a teacher he would apply for a teaching position\" suggests that applying for a teaching position is a logical step for someone who wants to become a teacher. It is based on the idea that in order to enter a profession, one must take the necessary steps to do so, such as applying for relevant positions. This is a generally accepted and common approach in career planning and goal-setting, as it aligns with the practical steps required to achieve a specific career objective.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1488, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If john wants to be a teacher he would simply show up at a school and ask for a job.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement, \"If John wants to be a teacher he would simply show up at a school and ask for a job,\" does not align with common sense. Becoming a teacher typically requires specific qualifications, such as a degree in education and a teaching license or certification. Additionally, there are formal hiring processes in place at schools which often involve submitting an application, going through interviews, and background checks. Simply showing up at a school and asking for a job is unlikely to be effective or appropriate. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 1489, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If john watches his favorite movie he would throw a remote at the tv.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If John watches his favorite movie he would throw a remote at the TV\" does not seem to align with common sense. Typically, when someone watches their favorite movie, they are likely to enjoy the experience and feel positive emotions, rather than reacting with anger or frustration that might prompt them to throw a remote at the TV. The statement contradicts the usual behavior one would expect in this situation. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 1490, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If john wears a lots of hats he has a lot of interests.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If John wears a lot of hats he has a lot of interests\" is using a metaphorical expression. In this context, \"wearing a lot of hats\" is an idiom that means taking on multiple roles or responsibilities, which may imply having diverse interests or skills. However, wearing literal hats does not necessarily correlate with having multiple interests. It's important to determine whether the statement refers to the metaphorical or literal sense. If it's metaphorical, there might be a connection, but if it's literal, there isn't necessarily a link between wearing hats and having diverse interests. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 1491, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If john were to get on a crowded train there would be many seats available.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If John were to get on a crowded train there would be many seats available\" contradicts itself. By definition, a crowded train implies that there are many passengers and limited seating availability. Therefore, if John were to get on a crowded train, it is unlikely that there would be many seats available. The statement does not align with common sense given the typical understanding of what constitutes a crowded train.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1492, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If john wins something he might not know the next line of action.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If John wins something he might not know the next line of action\" suggests uncertainty in knowing what to do after achieving a victory. This could be common sense if John lacks experience, planning, or guidance regarding the aftermath of winning. Winning can sometimes be unexpected, and without preparation or foresight, it is plausible that someone might be unsure of their subsequent steps. Therefore, the statement reflects a common human experience of uncertainty and unpreparedness in new situations.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1493, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If mary and john go separate ways mary will follow john.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Mary and John go separate ways, Mary will follow John\" seems contradictory. If they are going separate ways, it logically implies that they are heading in different directions and not following each other. Therefore, the idea that Mary would follow John while they are going separate ways does not align with common sense. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 1494, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If mary breaks john's foot he will wish it didn't happen.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Mary breaks John's foot he will wish it didn't happen\" is based on the assumption that experiencing physical injury, such as a broken foot, typically results in pain and inconvenience. Most people would prefer to avoid pain and the limitations associated with an injury. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that John would wish the injury had not occurred. \n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1495, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If mary cuts john's arm they will try to stop the bleeding.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Mary cuts John's arm, they will try to stop the bleeding\" is based on the natural human instinct to prevent further harm and address injuries. When someone is injured and bleeding, the typical response is to take measures to stop the bleeding to prevent blood loss and reduce the risk of infection. This is a common and expected reaction in such situations. Therefore, the statement aligns with common sense as it describes a reasonable and expected action in response to an injury.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1496, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If mary drives a car on the highway she is under the influence of alcohol.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Mary drives a car on the highway she is under the influence of alcohol\" is not necessarily common sense. Common sense would suggest that driving under the influence of alcohol is dangerous and illegal, but it does not imply that every time someone drives on the highway, they are under the influence of alcohol. It is possible for Mary to drive on the highway while being sober. Therefore, this statement is an assumption and not based on common sense, as it does not apply universally to all instances of driving on the highway. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 1497, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If mary files for bankruptcy then john would ask mary for a loan.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Mary files for bankruptcy then John would ask Mary for a loan\" does not align with common sense. Filing for bankruptcy typically indicates that an individual is facing severe financial distress and unable to meet their financial obligations. Therefore, it would be unlikely for someone in such a situation to have the capacity to provide a loan to others. Asking someone who has just filed for bankruptcy for a loan would not be a logical or practical decision. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 1498, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If mary gives jake instructions it is more likely to be wrong.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Mary gives Jake instructions it is more likely to be wrong\" implies that Mary consistently provides incorrect instructions to Jake, or that Jake is more likely to misunderstand or misinterpret instructions from Mary. Without further context or evidence supporting the claim, it is not possible to determine the accuracy of the statement. Common sense would suggest that the likelihood of instructions being wrong depends on various factors such as Mary's knowledge, Jake's comprehension skills, and the complexity of the task, rather than simply the interaction between Mary and Jake. Therefore, it is not reasonable to generalize based on the individuals involved without additional information.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1499, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If mary joins the chess club she will learn how to play and will want to compete.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Mary joins the chess club she will learn how to play and will want to compete\" suggests that joining the chess club would provide Mary with the opportunity and resources to learn how to play chess and could potentially increase her interest in participating in competitions. Joining a club generally implies an interest in the activity already, and being surrounded by others who are skilled and enthusiastic about chess could naturally lead to improved skills and increased motivation to compete. However, it is not guaranteed that she will want to compete, as individual interests and motivations can vary. Therefore, while it is reasonable to expect that she will learn to play, her desire to compete is not certain. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 1500, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If mary kills john's brother mary will try to cover her tracks.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Mary kills John's brother, Mary will try to cover her tracks\" is based on the assumption that someone who commits a serious crime like murder would likely attempt to avoid detection and punishment. This is a logical and reasonable assumption, as most individuals would not want to face legal consequences for their actions. Additionally, the instinct for self-preservation and fear of repercussions would motivate someone to hide their involvement in a crime. \n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1501, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If mary meets john's friends she would talk to them.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Mary meets John's friends she would talk to them\" is based on the assumption that Mary would engage in conversation when introduced to new people, which is a common social behavior. It suggests that Mary is sociable and willing to interact with John\u2019s friends upon meeting them. Since this is a typical response in a social setting, it aligns with general expectations of behavior when individuals are introduced to one another.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1502, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If mary moves into a new house she won't live in an apartment.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Mary moves into a new house she won't live in an apartment\" suggests that moving into a house and living in an apartment are mutually exclusive scenarios. By definition, a house is a standalone building, while an apartment is a unit within a larger building shared with other units. Therefore, if Mary moves into a house, she will not be living in an apartment because the two types of dwellings are distinct. The statement aligns with the common understanding of the difference between a house and an apartment.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1503, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If mary plans john's wedding it will be organized and neat.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that Mary has the skills and qualities necessary to plan an organized and neat wedding for John. However, without further information about Mary's experience or capabilities in wedding planning, it is difficult to definitively say that her involvement would guarantee those outcomes. This statement relies on assumptions about Mary's abilities and may not necessarily be common sense as it lacks specific evidence or context. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 1504, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If mary takes john's flu shot they wouldn't tell anyone.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that both Mary and John would keep the act of Mary taking John's flu shot a secret. The reasoning behind this could be that it might be unethical or against medical regulations for someone to take a flu shot that was prescribed or intended for another person. Additionally, there may be concerns about privacy or personal health information that they would not want to disclose. Therefore, it is common sense that they would choose not to tell anyone about this situation to avoid potential consequences or judgment.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1505, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If mary threw a surprise birthday party for john she would tell all the invitees to tell him about it beforehand.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement does not align with common sense because the purpose of a surprise party is for it to be unexpected by the guest of honor. Telling all the invitees to inform the guest of honor beforehand would defeat the purpose of it being a surprise. Therefore, the statement contradicts the basic concept of a surprise party. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 1506, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If mary took john's allowance the police would tell john that mary stole it.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Mary took John's allowance the police would tell John that Mary stole it\" implies that the police would be involved in a minor domestic issue, which is unlikely unless the situation escalates or involves a significant amount of money. In most cases, such small-scale disputes would typically be resolved within the family or between the individuals involved, without police intervention. Therefore, the statement does not align with common sense as it assumes an automatic and formal legal response to a minor issue.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1507, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If mary wanted to be a teacher she would become a painter.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Mary wanted to be a teacher she would become a painter\" does not seem to follow common sense because the desire to be a teacher and becoming a painter are not logically connected. Typically, if someone wants to be a teacher, they would pursue education and training in teaching, not painting. The statement presents a non sequitur, where the conclusion does not logically follow from the premise. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 1508, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If mary wants someone to mow her lawn a company will do it.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Mary wants someone to mow her lawn a company will do it\" suggests that there are companies available that offer lawn mowing services and Mary can hire one if she chooses to. This is a logical and reasonable assumption, as there are many companies that provide such services. Therefore, if Mary desires to have her lawn mowed and is willing to hire a company, it is likely that she can find one to do the job.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1509, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If mary wins a thousand dollars she would want to go shopping.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Mary wins a thousand dollars she would want to go shopping\" makes an assumption about Mary's desires and preferences based on receiving a sum of money. It is common for people to consider spending or treating themselves when they receive an unexpected financial windfall. However, without knowing Mary's specific interests, financial situation, or priorities, it's not possible to definitively say that she would want to go shopping. The statement relies on a generalization and may not apply to everyone. Therefore, whether it is common sense or not would depend on additional context about Mary's personality and circumstances. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 1510, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max about to get married then max feels happy.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If max is about to get married then max feels happy\" assumes that getting married is inherently a positive and joyous occasion for everyone. However, emotions can vary greatly from person to person depending on their individual circumstances, feelings about marriage, and their relationship. Happiness is not a guaranteed emotion for everyone who is about to get married. Some might feel anxious, stressed, or even unhappy due to various personal or external factors. Therefore, it is not universally applicable or common sense to assume that everyone feels happy when they are about to get married. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 1511, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max about to get married then max gets ring.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max is about to get married then Max gets a ring\" is based on a common cultural practice where individuals exchange rings as a symbol of commitment during a wedding ceremony. This tradition is prevalent in many societies, and the act of giving and receiving a ring is often seen as a key element of a marriage ceremony. Therefore, it can be considered common sense to expect Max to get a ring if he is about to get married, based on these cultural norms. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1512, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max about to get married then max is anxious.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max is about to get married then Max is anxious\" implies that getting married is a significant life event that can naturally lead to feelings of anxiety or nervousness. Marriage often involves substantial changes in personal life, responsibilities, and future plans, which can be overwhelming and cause anxiety. Although individual reactions to marriage can vary, it is not uncommon for people to experience some level of anxiety leading up to their wedding day.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that this statement might not be true for everyone, as some might feel more excitement than anxiety. But generally, it can be considered a common reaction.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1513, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max about to get married then max is excited.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max is about to get married then Max is excited\" implies a common emotional response to an upcoming significant life event. In general, many people feel excited and joyful about getting married, as it is a celebration of love and partnership. However, it's important to consider that not everyone may feel excited due to various personal reasons, such as stress, anxiety, or other emotions related to commitment. Despite individual differences, the statement reflects a common positive sentiment often associated with marriage. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1514, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max about to get married then max is nervous.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If max is about to get married then max is nervous\" implies that getting married is a significant life event that can naturally cause feelings of nervousness or anxiety. It is common for individuals to experience nervousness during major life changes and commitments, such as marriage, due to the uncertainty and importance of the event. Therefore, the statement aligns with a typical emotional response one might expect under such circumstances.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1515, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max about to get married then max needs meet someone.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max is about to get married then Max needs to meet someone\" implies that Max cannot get married without first meeting someone to marry. This is based on the logical premise that marriage involves a partnership between at least two individuals. Therefore, if Max has not yet met someone, he cannot proceed with marriage. This is a basic and straightforward understanding of how relationships leading to marriage typically form. \nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1516, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max about to get married then max wants to be happily married.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max is about to get married then Max wants to be happily married\" generally aligns with common sense because it suggests a natural human desire for happiness and fulfillment in a committed relationship. Most people entering into marriage likely hope for a positive and joyful union. Therefore, the statement reflects a common expectation and aspiration that individuals have when deciding to marry. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1517, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max about to get married then max wants to go on a honey moon.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max is about to get married then Max wants to go on a honeymoon\" generally aligns with common expectations and societal norms, as honeymoons are traditionally associated with celebrating a new marriage. However, it is important to acknowledge that individual desires and preferences vary. Not all newlyweds may desire or prioritize a honeymoon due to personal, financial, or other reasons. Despite the general assumption, it cannot be universally applied to everyone, including Max. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 1518, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max about to get married then sam feels happy.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max is about to get married then Sam feels happy\" implies a direct correlation between Max's marital status and Sam's emotional state. Without additional context about the relationship between Max and Sam, it's difficult to determine if this statement reflects common sense. Common sense would suggest that if Sam and Max have a positive relationship, such as being close friends or family, then it's likely that Sam would feel happy for Max's milestone. However, without knowing the nature of their relationship, the statement can't be universally accepted as common sense. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 1519, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max about to get married then sam gets dress.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max is about to get married then Sam gets a dress\" does not necessarily follow common sense without additional context. The connection between Max getting married and Sam getting a dress isn't clearly established by the statement alone. It could make sense if Sam is involved in the wedding and needs a dress for the occasion, but without that context, it's not a logical or common sense conclusion. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 1520, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max about to get married then sam says yes.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max is about to get married then Sam says yes\" does not appear to be based on common sense as there is no clear or logical connection between Max getting married and Sam saying yes. The statement lacks context and does not provide any information about the relationship between Max and Sam or the reason why Sam's response would be contingent on Max's marital status. It seems to be an arbitrary statement without a sensible link between the two events.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1521, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max absolutely loved it then max feels joyful.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If max absolutely loved it then max feels joyful\" implies a cause-and-effect relationship between loving something and feeling joyful. Common sense suggests that when a person loves something, it typically brings them joy and happiness. Therefore, if Max absolutely loved something, it is reasonable to assume that he would feel joyful as a result. This connection between positive experiences and feelings of joy aligns with general human emotions and responses.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1522, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max absolutely loved it then max is enthused.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If max absolutely loved it then max is enthused\" suggests a logical connection between loving something absolutely and being enthused. In common understanding, if someone loves something absolutely, it implies a strong positive emotional response. Being enthused similarly indicates a high level of excitement or passion about something. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that if Max absolutely loved something, he would naturally be enthused about it. This connection between loving something absolutely and being enthused is consistent with typical emotional responses, making the statement align with common sense.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1523, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max absolutely loved it then max stomped feet.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If max absolutely loved it then max stomped feet\" does not necessarily align with common sense, as the behavior of stomping feet is not a typical or universally recognized expression of love or enjoyment. Stomping feet is more commonly associated with frustration, anger, or impatience. People may express love or enjoyment through smiling, clapping, cheering, or other positive gestures, but stomping feet is not a conventional response in this context. Therefore, the statement does not reflect a typical or logical reaction to something that is loved. \n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1524, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max absolutely loved it then max wants to show it to everyone.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If max absolutely loved it then max wants to show it to everyone\" assumes that Max's enjoyment of something compels him to share it with others. This could be true for some individuals who are naturally inclined to share their positive experiences, but it may not be universally applicable. People have different personalities and preferences when it comes to sharing. Some might prefer to keep their favorite things private or might not feel the need to share them with everyone.\n\nThus, it cannot be considered common sense to assume that everyone who loves something would want to show it to everyone. Personal preferences play a significant role in determining whether someone would share something they loved.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1525, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max absolutely loved then max gains knowledge.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If max absolutely loved then max gains knowledge\" suggests that there is a direct correlation between experiencing love and acquiring knowledge. While love can inspire and motivate individuals to learn and grow, it is not necessarily the case that love always leads to gaining knowledge. Love can influence personal development in various ways, but it is not a guaranteed pathway to knowledge acquisition in every situation. The relationship between love and knowledge is not universally applicable or straightforward.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1526, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max absolutely loved then max is faithful.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If max absolutely loved then max is faithful\" suggests that being deeply in love correlates directly with being faithful in a relationship. This is a common assumption that love and faithfulness are interconnected, as love often involves commitment and loyalty. However, it's important to note that love and faithfulness are complex human behaviors influenced by various factors, including individual values, relationship dynamics, and personal experiences. While it is idealistic to believe that deep love ensures faithfulness, it is not always the case in reality. Therefore, the statement might not hold true universally. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 1527, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max absolutely loved then max wants to propose to her.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max absolutely loved her then Max wants to propose to her\" suggests a direct correlation between Max's feelings of love and his desire to propose. However, this may not necessarily be the case for everyone. The decision to propose can depend on various factors such as personal beliefs about marriage, readiness for commitment, external circumstances, and more. Loving someone deeply does not automatically equate to wanting to propose or feeling ready for marriage. \n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1528, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max abuses max's power then max become weak.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that when someone abuses their power, they ultimately become weak. This can be interpreted as losing credibility, trust, and support from others, which can weaken their influence and authority. Power abuse often leads to negative consequences such as isolation and loss of allies, which diminish the abuser's strength and effectiveness. Therefore, the statement aligns with the idea that the misuse of power can lead to a decline in one's overall strength and position. \n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1529, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max abuses max's power then max feels corrupt.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If max abuses max's power then max feels corrupt\" suggests a correlation between the abuse of power and the feeling of being corrupt. It is a common psychological phenomenon that engaging in unethical or immoral behavior, such as abusing power, can lead to feelings of guilt or corruption. However, this may not always be the case, as some individuals may not experience these feelings or may rationalize their actions. Despite this, the general idea that abusing power can lead to feeling corrupt aligns with common moral and ethical principles. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1530, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max abuses max's power then max is arrested.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If max abuses max's power then max is arrested\" suggests a direct consequence of abuse of power leading to arrest. In reality, not all cases of power abuse may lead to arrest, as it depends on the severity of the abuse, the legal framework in place, and the effectiveness of law enforcement. The statement assumes a just and effective legal system that consistently holds individuals accountable for their actions. However, in practice, this may not always be the case.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1531, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max abuses max's power then max is careless.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "Abusing power typically involves acting recklessly or without regard for the consequences of one's actions, which can be seen as a form of carelessness. When someone abuses their power, they often disregard the ethical or responsible use of that power, and prioritize their own desires or benefits over the well-being of others. This can lead to negative outcomes and can be considered an act of carelessness, as it shows a lack of consideration and caution. Therefore, the statement that abusing power equates to being careless aligns with this reasoning.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1532, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max abuses max's power then max is confident.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If max abuses max's power then max is confident\" does not necessarily align with common sense, as the abuse of power and confidence are not inherently linked. Abusing power could stem from various psychological factors such as insecurity, fear, or a desire for control, rather than confidence. Confidence typically implies a positive and secure self-assurance in one's abilities, which does not inherently involve the misuse of power over others. Therefore, the claim that abusing power is an indicator of confidence is not a universally valid or common-sense assertion. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 1533, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max abuses max's power then max is ostracized.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests a causal relationship between abusing power and being ostracized. In many societies, individuals who abuse their power often face social repercussions, as it goes against ethical norms and principles of fairness. Ostracism, or exclusion from a group, serves as a form of punishment and deterrent for such behavior. However, the outcome can depend on various factors, including the severity of the abuse, the individual's position, and the societal context. Despite these variables, the general idea that abusing power can lead to social exclusion is a concept that aligns with common notions of justice and accountability. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1534, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max abuses max's power then max is out of line.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that abusing power is inappropriate and crosses ethical boundaries. It is generally understood that individuals in positions of power have a responsibility to use that power judically and ethically. Abusing power typically involves exploiting one's authority for personal gain or to the detriment of others, which is widely regarded as unacceptable behavior. Therefore, the statement aligns with common ethical principles about responsibility and fairness.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1535, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max abuses max's power then max needs to be in power.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If max abuses max's power then max needs to be in power\" is not necessarily common sense. Common sense would suggest that if someone abuses their power, they should be removed from power or held accountable, rather than needing to stay in power. The statement seems to contradict the typical understanding of ethical leadership and responsible governance, where power should be exercised responsibly and for the common good. Allowing someone who abuses power to remain in power could lead to further abuse and negative consequences. Therefore, it is not aligned with common sense to suggest that someone who abuses power needs to remain in power.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1536, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max abuses max's power then max needs to become a manager.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If max abuses max's power then max needs to become a manager\" does not align with common sense. Typically, abusing power is considered a negative action that demonstrates a lack of responsibility and integrity. In most cases, someone who abuses power would not be considered suitable for a managerial position, which often requires a higher level of responsibility and ethical behavior. Promoting someone who abuses power could lead to further misuse of authority and negative consequences for the organization. Therefore, the statement does not reflect a logical or sensible course of action. \n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1537, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max abuses max's power then max needs to have people work for him.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If max abuses max's power then max needs to have people work for him\" implies that in order to abuse power, one must have subordinates or individuals working under them. This makes sense because abusing power generally involves misusing authority over others. If there are no people under max's authority, there wouldn't be a way for max to exert or abuse power over anyone. Thus, having people work for max is necessary for the context of power abuse.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1538, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max abuses max's power then max needs to take over.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that if someone abuses their power, they should further consolidate that power by taking over, which seems counterintuitive and potentially dangerous. In situations where power is abused, it is generally more reasonable to seek checks and balances, or to remove power from the abuser, rather than allowing them to gain more control. Encouraging further power consolidation in the hands of an abuser could lead to more harm and less accountability. \n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1539, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max abuses max's power then max wants to be in charge.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If max abuses max's power then max wants to be in charge\" suggests a correlation between the abuse of power and the desire to be in charge. Common sense would dictate that if someone abuses their power, it could imply that they enjoy the authority and control that comes with being in charge, and thus, desire to maintain or increase that position. However, it is also possible that someone could abuse power unintentionally or due to other factors like lack of awareness, poor management skills, or external pressures, which does not necessarily mean they want to be in charge.\n\nGiven these considerations, the statement might not hold true in every scenario as the desire to be in charge is not the sole reason someone might abuse power. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 1540, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max abuses max's power then max wants to take even more power.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max abuses Max's power then Max wants to take even more power\" suggests that the abuse of power leads to a desire for more power. This idea is rooted in the psychological concept of the \"corruptive cycle\" where initial instances of abusing power can lead to increased desire for power as a means to maintain or expand control and influence. This phenomenon is common in various social, political, and organizational contexts, where power can become addictive and self-perpetuating. Therefore, it is reasonable to believe that someone who abuses power might be inclined to seek even more power to sustain their dominance or control.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1541, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max abuses max's power then sam are told what to do.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If max abuses max's power then sam are told what to do\" is not necessarily common sense because it assumes a direct cause-and-effect relationship between someone abusing their power and another person being instructed on what to do. The statement lacks clarity on who \"max\" and \"sam\" are, and the connection between the abuse of power and the instructions given to \"sam\" is not explained or justified. Common sense would require a more explicit and logical connection between the actions and consequences presented in the statement. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 1542, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max abuses max's power then sam feels cheated.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If max abuses max's power then sam feels cheated\" suggests a cause-and-effect relationship where the abuse of power by Max leads to Sam feeling cheated. This could be a common scenario in situations where Max holds a position of authority or influence over Sam, and Sam relies on Max to act fairly. If Max misuses his power, it could naturally lead to feelings of betrayal or injustice for Sam. However, whether this statement is considered common sense depends on the context of Max and Sam's relationship and the specific circumstances of the abuse of power. In general, it is reasonable to assume that abuse of power can lead to feelings of being cheated by those affected by the abuse.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1543, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max abuses max's power then sam feels humiliated.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If max abuses max's power then sam feels humiliated\" is contingent on the specific context and relationship between Max and Sam. It assumes a direct causal relationship between Max's abuse of power and Sam's emotional response. However, it is not necessarily common sense as it simplifies the complexity of human emotions and interactions, and assumes a uniform response from Sam without considering other factors that could influence his feelings. Additionally, it does not account for the possibility that Sam may not feel humiliated, or may have different reactions depending on the situation or his personal resilience. Therefore, without additional context to clarify the dynamics between Max and Sam, it is not appropriate to consider this statement as common sense. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 1544, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max abuses max's power then sam wants get max fired.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that if Max abuses his power, then Sam wants to get Max fired. This could be seen as a logical reaction if Sam believes that Max's abuse of power is harmful to the organization or goes against ethical standards. Wanting to remove someone from a position of power when they are misusing it can be a way to protect the integrity of the organization or group. However, without additional context about the relationship between Sam and Max, the severity of the abuse, and the policies of the organization, it's difficult to definitively say whether this reaction is common sense.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1545, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max abuses max's power then sam wants report max to hr.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If max abuses max's power then sam wants to report max to hr\" suggests that Sam, being a responsible employee or colleague, recognizes the importance of addressing power abuse in the workplace. Reporting such behavior to human resources (HR) is a common and appropriate course of action to ensure that the issue is addressed and to maintain a healthy work environment. It reflects a sense of accountability and ethical responsibility.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1546, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max abuses max's power then sam wants to depose max.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If max abuses max's power then sam wants to depose max\" suggests a cause-and-effect relationship where the abuse of power by Max leads to Sam wanting to depose him. This can be seen as a common sense reaction, as abuse of power often leads to discontent and a desire for change among those affected by or witnessing the abuse. It is generally expected that individuals would want to remove someone from power if they are misusing it.\n\nHowever, without additional context about the specific motivations, values, and relationship between Sam and Max, it is difficult to definitively say this reaction would occur in every situation. Common sense can vary depending on cultural, social, and personal factors.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1547, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max abuses max's power then sam wants to elect another leader.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If max abuses max's power then sam wants to elect another leader\" is based on the reasoning that if a leader misuses their authority, it may lead to a loss of trust and confidence among those they lead. In such a situation, it is common for members or constituents to desire a change in leadership to ensure accountability and better governance. Therefore, it makes sense that Sam would want to elect another leader in response to Max's abuse of power.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1548, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max abuses max's power then sam wants to hurt max.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests a causal relationship between Max abusing power and Sam wanting to hurt Max. Common sense dictates that abusing power can lead to negative consequences and evoke strong emotions in others, including anger or the desire for retribution. However, the desire to hurt someone as a response is not a universally accepted or reasonable reaction, as it promotes violence and does not align with common ethical standards or conflict resolution methods. Therefore, while the first part of the statement (abusing power leading to negative reactions) aligns with common sense, the specific reaction of wanting to hurt someone is not a common sense or universally accepted response.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1549, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max abuses max's power then sam wants to impeach prrsonx.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If max abuses max's power then sam wants to impeach personx\" lacks clarity and context, making it difficult to determine if it is common sense. It is unclear who \"max\" and \"sam\" are, and whether \"personx\" refers to \"max\" or someone else. Additionally, the statement does not specify the nature of the power being abused or the role of \"sam\" in relation to \"max\" and \"personx\". Without further context and details, the statement cannot be assessed as common sense. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 1550, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max abuses max's power then sam wants to punish max.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests a causal relationship between abuse of power and a desire for punishment. It implies that when someone misuses their authority or power, it is natural for others to seek accountability or consequences for that behavior. This aligns with general ethical principles and societal norms that discourage abuse of power and encourage corrective actions to maintain fairness and justice. Therefore, the statement reflects a common understanding of moral responsibility and consequence.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1551, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max abuses max's power then sam wants to remove max.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests a scenario where an individual named Max misuses their authority, leading to another individual, Sam, desiring to remove Max from a position of power. This can be seen as a common-sense reaction as it is generally expected that abuse of power should have consequences and those affected or observing the abuse would want to rectify the situation by removing the individual from their position to prevent further misuse. Additionally, holding individuals accountable for their actions is a foundational principle in many societies.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1552, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max abuses max's power then sam wants to stop max.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that if Max abuses his power, then Sam wants to stop Max. This could be seen as common sense if we assume that Sam is someone who values justice and fairness, and therefore would want to intervene if he sees someone abusing their power. Additionally, the desire to stop someone who is abusing their power could be seen as a natural response to uphold moral or ethical standards. However, without specific context about the relationship between Max and Sam or the nature of the power being abused, it's hard to definitively say if this statement is common sense for everyone.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1553, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accepts happily then max feels grateful.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests a causal relationship between accepting something happily and feeling grateful. Generally, when someone accepts something with a positive attitude, such as being happy, it implies a sense of appreciation and contentment, which can naturally lead to feelings of gratitude. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that if Max accepts something happily, he is likely to feel grateful for it.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1554, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accepts happily then max intends to to take the opportunity.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests a causal relationship between Max's acceptance of an opportunity and his intentions. Common sense dictates that accepting something \"happily\" indicates a positive attitude and willingness towards that opportunity, which implies intention. If Max did not intend to take the opportunity, he would likely not accept it happily. Therefore, the statement aligns with common sense reasoning about human behavior and intentions.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1555, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accepts happily then max is accepting.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If max accepts happily then max is accepting\" is based on the implication that if Max performs an action with a certain attitude (happily), then it necessarily follows that he performs the action itself (accepting). In this case, accepting happily implies that Max is indeed participating in the act of accepting. The statement is logical and straightforward because in order to accept happily, one must first be accepting. Therefore, it aligns with common sense that if Max accepts happily, then he is indeed accepting.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1556, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accepts happily then max is appreciative.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max accepts happily then Max is appreciative\" implies a connection between Max's emotional response to accepting something and his attitude of gratitude. Accepting something happily suggests that Max is pleased and satisfied with what he is receiving, which often correlates with feeling thankful and appreciative. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that if Max accepts something with a positive and happy demeanor, he likely appreciates it.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1557, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accepts happily then max is gracious.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests a relationship between accepting something happily and being gracious. Accepting something happily implies a positive attitude and appreciation, which are characteristics of being gracious. Therefore, it seems reasonable to infer that if Max accepts something happily, he is demonstrating gracious behavior.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1558, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accepts happily then max is grateful.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests a causal relationship between accepting something happily and feeling grateful. Generally, when someone accepts something with a positive attitude, it implies that they appreciate and value it, which is closely related to feeling grateful. Therefore, it is reasonable to infer that if Max accepts something happily, he is likely experiencing gratitude. However, it's important to note that this may not always be the case as individuals can express happiness for reasons other than gratitude.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1559, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accepts happily then max is humble.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If max accepts happily then max is humble\" suggests that Max's willingness to accept something with a positive attitude is an indication of his humility. Humility often involves having a modest view of one's own importance and being open to others' ideas or help, which can be reflected in happily accepting something. However, acceptance with happiness does not necessarily equate to humility as it could be influenced by other factors such as personal gain, social pressure, or emotional state.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1560, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accepts happily then max is thankful.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests a causal relationship between acceptance and gratitude. When Max accepts something \"happily,\" it implies that he is pleased or satisfied with what he is accepting, which naturally leads to a feeling of thankfulness. Being happy with something generally correlates with feeling grateful for it. Therefore, it is common sense to deduce that if Max accepts something happily, he would also be thankful for it. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1561, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accepts happily then max thanks someone.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests a causal relationship between Max accepting something happily and expressing gratitude by thanking someone. It aligns with common social norms and behavior, where expressing gratitude is a typical response when one is pleased or satisfied with something. It is reasonable to expect that if Max is happy with what he has received or accepted, he would naturally extend thanks as a gesture of appreciation. Such behavior is commonly observed and encouraged in social interactions as a sign of good manners and positive reinforcement.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1562, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accepts happily then max wants follow through.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests a cause-and-effect relationship between Max's acceptance of something and his willingness to follow through with it. It assumes that if Max accepts something \"happily,\" it implies a positive attitude and commitment towards the action or decision, thereby increasing the likelihood that he would want to follow through. Although this might often be the case, it is not necessarily universally true as individual motivations and circumstances can vary. Accepting something happily does not always guarantee the follow-through, as unforeseen factors or changes in circumstances could affect Max's ability or desire to complete the action.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1563, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accepts happily then max wants to go to the party.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests a causal relationship between Max's acceptance and his desire to attend the party. If Max accepts the invitation \"happily,\" it implies that he is pleased or enthusiastic about the prospect of attending the party. This expression of happiness in accepting the invitation can be seen as an indicator of his desire to be at the event. In general, people are likely to accept invitations happily if they genuinely want to participate in the event. Therefore, it is reasonable to infer that Max's happy acceptance reflects his desire to attend the party. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1564, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accepts happily then sam says you're welcome.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If max accepts happily then sam says you're welcome\" does not necessarily align with common sense as it assumes a specific interaction and response between two individuals without providing context or a causal relationship. Common sense would suggest that responses in social interactions depend on a variety of factors such as the nature of the interaction, individual personalities, and the specific circumstances surrounding the exchange. The statement appears to imply a direct and automatic correlation between Max's acceptance and Sam's response, which is not typically how social interactions function in a nuanced and context-dependent manner. Therefore, it cannot be considered a common-sense statement without further information.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1565, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accepts happily then sam wants to throw a party.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If max accepts happily then sam wants to throw a party\" is contingent on the specific context and relationship between Max and Sam. It is not a universally understood or predictable outcome based solely on common sense, as it relies on personal motivations and circumstances specific to the individuals involved. Common sense does not inherently dictate that one person's happiness in acceptance would necessarily lead another to want to throw a party. Therefore, this statement is not grounded in common sense without additional context.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1566, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accepts into college then max attends freshman orientation.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max accepts into college then Max attends freshman orientation\" is not necessarily common sense. Accepting an offer to attend a college does not automatically imply that Max will attend freshman orientation. There could be various reasons why Max might not attend, such as scheduling conflicts, personal circumstances, or a decision to defer enrollment. Orientation is typically an optional event for incoming students to learn more about the campus and resources, but it is not mandatory for enrollment. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 1567, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accepts into college then max feels very happy.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max gets accepted into college then Max feels very happy\" is based on the assumption that getting accepted into college is a positive and significant achievement, which generally leads to feelings of happiness and accomplishment. For most people, acceptance into college represents the culmination of hard work and dedication, and the opportunity for further personal and professional growth. It is a common emotional response to feel happy when achieving such a milestone.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1568, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accepts into college then max gets a loan.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max gets accepted into college then Max gets a loan\" implies a cause-and-effect relationship between college acceptance and obtaining a loan. It suggests that getting accepted into college leads to Max securing a loan, possibly to pay for tuition and other expenses. While it is common for students to seek financial aid or loans to fund their education, acceptance into college does not automatically guarantee that a loan will be granted. Loans usually require separate applications and approvals based on financial need, creditworthiness, or other criteria set by the lender. Therefore, the statement assumes a direct correlation that may not universally hold true in every case.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1569, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accepts into college then max is hopeful.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max gets accepted into college then Max is hopeful\" suggests that Max's acceptance into college would make him feel optimistic or positive about his future. This is a reasonable assumption, as getting accepted into college is often seen as a significant achievement and can open up new opportunities, which can lead to feelings of hopefulness. However, it's important to note that individual reactions can vary, and not everyone may feel hopeful in the same situation.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1570, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accepts into college then max studies.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max gets accepted into college then Max studies\" suggests a cause-and-effect relationship where being accepted into college motivates or necessitates Max to study. In reality, acceptance into college does not guarantee that a person will study; it depends on the individual's motivation, discipline, and circumstances. Although it is common for students to study once accepted into college to succeed academically, it is not a rule that applies universally to everyone. Therefore, this statement cannot be considered common sense as it assumes a direct correlation where there may not be one. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 1571, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accepts max's diploma then max feels accomplished.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If max accepts max's diploma then max feels accomplished\" suggests a cause-and-effect relationship where accepting a diploma leads to a feeling of accomplishment. In general, receiving a diploma typically signifies the completion of a program or degree, which often leads to a sense of achievement and fulfillment. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that accepting one's own diploma would elicit feelings of accomplishment, as it is a recognition of hard work and success.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1572, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accepts max's diploma then max feels proud.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If max accepts max's diploma then max feels proud\" suggests a cause-and-effect relationship where accepting a diploma leads to feeling proud. It is common for individuals to feel a sense of pride and accomplishment upon receiving or accepting a diploma, as it often represents the culmination of hard work and dedication. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that accepting a diploma would instill a feeling of pride in most individuals. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1573, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accepts max's diploma then max graduates college.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If max accepts max's diploma then max graduates college\" is not necessarily common sense. Accepting a diploma is usually a result of having already graduated, not a condition for graduation. Graduation is determined by fulfilling academic requirements set by the college, not by accepting the diploma. The diploma is a symbol of graduation, but the act of accepting it does not cause or ensure that graduation has occurred. Therefore, the statement is not logically or causally correct in the typical understanding of college graduation processes.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1574, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accepts max's diploma then max intends to to graduate from high school.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max accepts Max's diploma then Max intends to graduate from high school\" suggests a logical progression where accepting a diploma is indicative of the intention to complete the requirements for graduation. Generally, accepting a diploma signifies that an individual has fulfilled the necessary criteria and is willingly acknowledging their accomplishment. If Max did not intend to graduate, he likely wouldn't accept the diploma, which is a symbol of graduation. Thus, the statement aligns with common sense reasoning about intentions and actions related to academic achievement.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1575, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accepts max's diploma then max is acquiring.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If max accepts max's diploma then max is acquiring\" suggests that accepting a diploma implies gaining or acquiring something, likely knowledge or credentials. Common sense would dictate that when a person accepts their diploma, they are indeed acquiring the recognition and validation of their education and skills, which is symbolized by the diploma. Therefore, the act of accepting a diploma does signify a form of acquisition, as it represents the culmination of learning and achievement.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1576, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accepts max's diploma then max is educated.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If max accepts max's diploma then max is educated\" is not necessarily common sense. Accepting a diploma does not inherently guarantee that Max is truly educated, as it only indicates that Max has met the requirements to earn the diploma. Education encompasses a broader understanding and application of knowledge and skills, which may not be fully captured by the mere possession of a diploma. Additionally, the statement's logic is somewhat circular, as it assumes the conclusion (Max is educated) based solely on the premise (Max accepts Max's diploma). Therefore, the validity and common sense of the statement depend on additional context about the quality of the education and the criteria for earning the diploma.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1577, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accepts max's diploma then max is satisfied.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If max accepts max's diploma then max is satisfied\" suggests a cause-and-effect relationship where accepting a diploma leads to satisfaction. This can be considered common sense if we assume that receiving and accepting a diploma is a significant achievement and generally leads to a feeling of satisfaction due to the accomplishment. However, it's important to note that this might not universally apply as individual perspectives on satisfaction can vary. Some might not find the diploma satisfactory due to various personal reasons or expectations. Nonetheless, generally speaking, accepting a diploma is likely to be associated with satisfaction.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1578, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accepts max's diploma then max needs go to the ceremony.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max accepts Max's diploma then Max needs to go to the ceremony\" implies a causal relationship between accepting a diploma and needing to attend a ceremony. Generally, accepting a diploma does not necessarily require one's presence at a graduation ceremony, as diplomas can be mailed or collected at a later time. The decision to attend the ceremony is usually optional and based on personal choice rather than a strict requirement tied to the acceptance of the diploma.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1579, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accepts max's diploma then max shakes a hand.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If max accepts max's diploma then max shakes a hand\" seems to lack a clear logical connection between the two actions. Accepting a diploma and shaking a hand are two distinct events that do not necessarily cause one another. Accepting a diploma typically involves receiving it during a graduation ceremony, while shaking a hand is a gesture that can occur in many different contexts, not exclusively linked to accepting a diploma. The statement does not provide enough context or reasoning to establish why one action would directly lead to the other. Therefore, it does not align with common sense to assume that accepting a diploma would automatically result in shaking a hand. \n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1580, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accepts max's diploma then max they cheer.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If max accepts max's diploma then max they cheer\" is not common sense because it is not clear and logically structured. The phrase \"max they cheer\" is grammatically incorrect and ambiguous, making it difficult to understand the intended meaning. Additionally, the connection between accepting a diploma and cheering is not explicitly explained or justified, which leaves room for confusion. \n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1581, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accepts max's diploma then max wants apply for college.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests a causal relationship between accepting a diploma and wanting to apply for college. Common sense would dictate that accepting a diploma indicates the completion of a certain level of education, which could naturally lead to the desire to pursue further education, such as college. However, the desire to apply for college may depend on various other factors including personal ambition, financial situation, and career goals, and not solely on accepting a diploma. Therefore, the statement does not necessarily hold true in all cases as it oversimplifies the decision-making process for applying to college. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 1582, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accepts max's diploma then max wants to attend college.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests a causal relationship between accepting a diploma and wanting to attend college. However, accepting a diploma generally signifies the completion of a previous educational program, not necessarily the intention to pursue further education. It is possible for someone to accept a diploma as recognition of their achievements without having the desire to attend college. Therefore, the statement does not logically follow common sense, as accepting a diploma does not inherently imply a desire to attend college.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1583, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accepts max's diploma then max wants to get a job.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max accepts Max's diploma then Max wants to get a job\" suggests a causal relationship between accepting a diploma and wanting to get a job. Accepting a diploma can be seen as an acknowledgment of completing one's education and being ready to enter the workforce. Wanting to get a job after graduation is a common next step for many individuals as they seek to apply their knowledge and skills in a professional setting, achieve financial independence, and build their careers. Therefore, the statement aligns with a typical progression from education to employment.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1584, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accepts max's diploma then sam feels excited.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If max accepts max's diploma then sam feels excited\" does not necessarily align with common sense, as there is no logical or direct connection established between Max accepting their diploma and Sam feeling excited. The emotional response of one person (Sam) to another person\u2019s (Max) acceptance of a diploma is not a typical or predictable outcome unless there is further context provided about their relationship or specific circumstances. Without additional information, the statement seems arbitrary and does not inherently make sense.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1585, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accepts sam appointment then max become boss.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max accepts Sam's appointment then Max becomes boss\" does not necessarily follow common sense without additional context. Accepting an appointment does not inherently lead to becoming a boss, unless the appointment itself is specifically for a leadership or managerial position and it is explicitly stated that accepting the appointment would result in Max becoming a boss. Without this context, the statement seems to make an assumption that lacks logical connection.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1586, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accepts sam appointment then max feels helpful.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max accepts Sam's appointment then Max feels helpful\" assumes that Max's emotional response to accepting an appointment is to feel helpful. This may not necessarily be true for everyone, as individuals can have different emotional responses to the same situation. Max might feel helpful, but he could also feel overwhelmed, indifferent, or even annoyed depending on his circumstances and personality. Therefore, it is not common sense to assume that accepting an appointment will always result in feeling helpful.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1587, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accepts sam appointment then max intends to to checkup on him.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement implies a cause-and-effect relationship between Max accepting Sam's appointment and Max's intention to check up on him. This suggests that the purpose of the appointment is for Max to monitor or assess Sam's condition, which is a reasonable assumption if Max is in a caregiving or medical profession. However, without additional context about the nature of their relationship or the purpose of the appointment, it is difficult to definitively say that this statement is common sense. It relies on assumptions about their roles and the intention behind the appointment. Therefore, while the statement could be plausible in certain scenarios, it is not universally common sense without further information.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1588, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accepts sam appointment then max is booked.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max accepts Sam's appointment then Max is booked\" implies that accepting an appointment results in Max having a scheduled commitment, thus making him unavailable for other appointments at that time. This is a logical consequence of accepting an appointment, as it generally means allocating specific time for that engagement, which indicates that Max's schedule is occupied during that period. Therefore, it is common sense to conclude that accepting an appointment leads to being booked for that time slot.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1589, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accepts sam appointment then max is humble.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max accepts Sam's appointment then Max is humble\" assumes that accepting an appointment is a direct indication of humility. However, accepting an appointment could be influenced by various factors such as professional obligations, personal interests, or social etiquette, and does not necessarily reflect personal humility. Humility is a character trait that involves a modest view of one's own importance and is not solely demonstrated by agreeing to meet someone. Therefore, the statement may oversimplify the complexity of humility and the reasons behind accepting an appointment.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1590, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accepts sam appointment then max needs to reserve appointment space.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that if Max accepts an appointment with Sam, then Max must ensure there is available space in his schedule for that appointment. This is a logical and practical requirement, as accepting an appointment implies a commitment to allocate time and resources for that engagement. Without reserving space in his schedule, Max would risk double-booking or being unprepared, which could lead to inefficiency and inconvenience. Therefore, it seems reasonable and common sensical to reserve space for an accepted appointment to ensure smooth planning and execution.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1591, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accepts sam appointment then max wants to follow up with sam.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If max accepts sam appointment then max wants to follow up with sam\" suggests a cause-and-effect relationship where accepting an appointment implies a desire for further interaction. However, accepting an appointment could be for various reasons such as obligation, professionalism, or courtesy, and does not necessarily indicate a desire for follow-up. The statement assumes a specific motivation that may not universally apply to all situations where an appointment is accepted. \n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1592, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accepts sam appointment then sam feels happy.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max accepts Sam's appointment then Sam feels happy\" implies that Sam's emotional state is dependent on Max accepting the appointment. This suggests that the appointment is important to Sam and that Max's acceptance positively impacts Sam's emotions. In general, people often feel happy or relieved when something they desire or anticipate is confirmed or goes as planned. Therefore, it makes sense that Sam would feel happy if Max accepts the appointment.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1593, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accepts sam invitation then max buys a present.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max accepts Sam's invitation then Max buys a present\" implies a social norm or expectation that when accepting an invitation to an event or gathering, it is customary to bring a present. This is often the case for events such as birthdays, weddings, or other celebrations where gifts are typically given. Therefore, the statement aligns with common social expectations and etiquette. \n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1594, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accepts sam invitation then max buys gift.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max accepts Sam's invitation then Max buys a gift\" is not necessarily common sense, as it depends on the context of the invitation. If the invitation is for an event where it is customary to bring a gift, such as a birthday party or a wedding, then it would make sense for Max to buy a gift. However, if the invitation is for a casual get-together or a non-gift-giving occasion, then buying a gift may not be expected or necessary. Therefore, the statement is not universally true or common sense without additional context. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 1595, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accepts sam invitation then max feels good.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max accepts Sam's invitation then Max feels good\" suggests that Max's acceptance of the invitation is directly linked to his feeling of happiness or satisfaction. This could be because Max values spending time with Sam, or because the event he was invited to is something he enjoys. However, it is important to note that this is not always necessarily the case, as Max's feelings could be influenced by various other factors such as his mood, the nature of the event, or external circumstances. Therefore, while the statement could be true in some cases, it is not a universal truth or common sense that applies to every situation.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1596, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accepts sam invitation then max feels included.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max accepts Sam's invitation then Max feels included\" suggests that accepting an invitation leads to feelings of inclusion. Generally, when someone accepts an invitation, it implies they are welcomed and wanted in the social setting or event, which can contribute to feeling included. This is a common social dynamic where acceptance of an invitation correlates with a sense of belonging. However, it's important to note that feeling included can also depend on other factors, such as the atmosphere of the event, the behavior of others, and Max's own perceptions and emotions. The statement assumes a direct cause (accepting the invitation) leading to an effect (feeling included) without considering other variables.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1597, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accepts sam invitation then max intends to the appreciation.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests a causal relationship between Max accepting Sam's invitation and Max's intention to show appreciation. Common sense indicates that accepting an invitation is generally a polite and positive response, often implying some level of appreciation for the invitation. However, the statement assumes that acceptance always equates to an intention to show appreciation, which may not necessarily be the case. Max could accept the invitation for various reasons, such as social obligation, personal gain, or simply to attend the event, without genuinely intending to show appreciation. Therefore, the statement assumes a specific intention that may not universally apply to all scenarios of accepting an invitation.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1598, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accepts sam invitation then max intends to to gain person's friendship.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement assumes that Max's intention in accepting Sam's invitation is solely to gain friendship, which may not always be the case. Accepting an invitation could be motivated by various reasons such as politeness, curiosity, wanting to network, or simply to enjoy the event. The statement oversimplifies the complexity of human intentions and relationships. Therefore, it is not necessarily common sense to assume that accepting an invitation equates to an intention to gain friendship.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1599, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accepts sam invitation then max is grateful.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max accepts Sam's invitation then Max is grateful\" assumes that accepting an invitation is a direct indication of gratitude. However, there could be various reasons why Max might accept the invitation, such as social obligation, personal benefit, or simply to maintain a good relationship, which do not necessarily reflect genuine gratitude. Therefore, the statement might not always hold true as it oversimplifies human behavior and motivation. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 1600, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accepts sam invitation then max is interesting.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max accepts Sam's invitation then Max is interesting\" is not necessarily common sense. Common sense would suggest that accepting an invitation doesn't inherently make a person interesting; rather, it could depend on various factors such as the nature of the invitation, the relationship between Max and Sam, and Max's personality or interests. The statement makes an assumption without considering these other factors.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1601, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accepts sam invitation then max is sociable.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If max accepts sam invitation then max is sociable\" is not necessarily common sense. Accepting an invitation does not automatically mean that someone is sociable. Max may have other reasons for accepting the invitation, such as obligation, interest in the event, or a desire to maintain a relationship with Sam, rather than an inherent sociability. Sociability generally refers to enjoying and seeking out social interactions, which cannot be definitively determined by a single action of accepting an invitation. Therefore, the statement may not be a reliable indicator of Max's sociability.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1602, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accepts sam invitation then max mails an rsvp to sam.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max accepts Sam's invitation, then Max mails an RSVP to Sam\" is based on the social convention that when someone accepts an invitation, they typically respond to confirm their attendance. Mailing an RSVP is a common way to formally respond to an invitation. Therefore, the statement aligns with general social expectations and etiquette.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1603, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accepts sam invitation then max needs be invited by sam.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests a logical relationship between Max accepting Sam's invitation and Max needing to be invited by Sam in the first place. In order for Max to accept an invitation, it is necessary that he has received an invitation from Sam. Thus, the condition of Max needing to be invited by Sam is a prerequisite for him to be able to accept the invitation. This is a basic requirement of common sense in understanding social interactions involving invitations. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1604, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accepts sam invitation then max wants go to engagement.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests a causal relationship between Max accepting Sam's invitation and Max's desire to attend the engagement. It assumes that accepting the invitation implies a genuine interest in attending the event. However, there could be various reasons why Max accepts the invitation, such as social obligation, not wanting to hurt Sam's feelings, or other external factors that don't necessarily reflect Max's personal desire to attend the engagement. Therefore, the statement does not universally hold true as common sense.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1605, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accepts sam invitation then max wants make a note.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max accepts Sam's invitation then Max wants to make a note\" does not necessarily follow common sense reasoning. Accepting an invitation does not inherently imply a desire or need to make a note. The connection between accepting an invitation and wanting to make a note relies on additional context that is not provided in the statement, such as Max's personal habits or reasons for needing a reminder. Without such context, it is not reasonable to assume that accepting an invitation universally leads to wanting to make a note.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1606, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accepts sam invitation then max wants to invite other people.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests a causal relationship between Max accepting Sam's invitation and Max wanting to invite other people. However, accepting an invitation doesn't necessarily imply a desire to invite additional people. Max could simply want to attend the event hosted by Sam without altering the guest list. The desire to invite others depends on various factors such as the nature of the event, Max's relationship with Sam, and Max's personal preferences, which are not addressed in the statement. Therefore, it's not common sense to assume that accepting an invitation always leads to wanting to invite more people.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1607, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accepts sam invitation then sam smiles.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max accepts Sam's invitation then Sam smiles\" suggests a cause-and-effect relationship where Sam's happiness is contingent on Max accepting his invitation. This could be considered common sense as it is typical for someone to feel happy or smile when a friend agrees to join them or participate in an event they have invited them to. The anticipation of spending time together and the affirmation of friendship can naturally lead to positive emotions like smiling.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1608, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accepts sam invitation then sam wants prepare to hang out with max.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement implies that Sam will prepare to hang out with Max only if Max accepts the invitation. This suggests that Sam's preparations are contingent on Max's acceptance, which is logical as Sam would want to ensure that the effort put into preparations is worthwhile and that the hangout will indeed occur. Therefore, this statement aligns with common sense reasoning as it reflects typical social behavior where preparations for an event or gathering are made once the participation of the other party is confirmed.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1609, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accepts sam invitation then sam wants wait for engagement.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests a causal relationship between Max accepting Sam's invitation and Sam's willingness to wait for engagement. It assumes that accepting an invitation directly influences Sam's decision to wait, which may not necessarily be common sense as individual decisions about engagement can depend on many personal factors like readiness, mutual understanding, and commitment levels, rather than just the acceptance of an invitation. It also lacks context about what kind of invitation is being discussed, which makes it difficult to determine the common sense nature of the statement. \n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1610, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accepts sam offer then max feels grateful.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max accepts Sam's offer then Max feels grateful\" implies that Max appreciates the gesture made by Sam. Generally, when someone accepts an offer, it is because they see value or benefit in it, which often leads to feelings of gratitude towards the person who made the offer. Feeling grateful is a common emotional response to receiving help or a favor from someone else. However, it is important to note that individual reactions can vary, and not everyone may feel grateful in the same situation.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1611, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accepts sam offer then max feels satisfied.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max accepts Sam's offer then Max feels satisfied\" implies that Max's acceptance of the offer is contingent on his satisfaction with the terms or benefits it provides. Generally, people tend to accept offers that align with their needs, desires, or expectations, leading to a sense of satisfaction. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that if Max accepts the offer, it is because it meets his criteria for satisfaction.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1612, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accepts sam offer then max gives sam item.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If max accepts sam offer then max gives sam item\" is a logical expression of a conditional agreement between two parties. In general, when someone accepts an offer, it typically implies that they agree to the terms of the offer, including any exchange of goods or services that may be involved. Therefore, if Max agrees to Sam's offer, it is reasonable to expect that Max will follow through with giving Sam the item as part of fulfilling the agreement. This is a common understanding in transactions and agreements.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1613, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accepts sam offer then max is fair.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max accepts Sam's offer then Max is fair\" assumes that accepting an offer is inherently fair, which may not always be the case. Fairness depends on the context and details of the offer, such as whether the offer is equitable, reasonable, and mutually beneficial. Additionally, fairness involves considering the interests and well-being of all parties involved. Simply accepting an offer does not guarantee that the action was fair, as the offer itself could be biased or one-sided. Therefore, the statement may not universally hold true as a measure of fairness. \n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1614, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accepts sam offer then max is haggler.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max accepts Sam's offer then Max is a haggler\" does not necessarily make common sense without additional context. Accepting an offer does not automatically imply that someone is a haggler. A haggler is generally defined as someone who negotiates or bargains persistently. Simply accepting an offer could mean that the offer was fair or exactly what Max was looking for, rather than indicating that he engaged in negotiation or bargaining. Therefore, the statement lacks a direct logical connection between accepting an offer and being a haggler.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1615, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accepts sam offer then max is humble.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max accepts Sam's offer then Max is humble\" assumes that accepting an offer is an indication of humility. However, the nature of the offer and the reasons for accepting it are not specified, and humility can be demonstrated in various ways, not just through accepting offers. Additionally, accepting an offer could be motivated by factors other than humility, such as necessity, opportunity, or politeness. Without more context, it is difficult to definitively link accepting an offer with being humble. Therefore, it is not necessarily common sense to assume that accepting an offer equates to humility. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 1616, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accepts sam offer then max marks the offer on his calendar.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max accepts Sam's offer, then Max marks the offer on his calendar\" suggests that Max uses his calendar to keep track of commitments he has agreed to. Marking the offer on the calendar would help Max remember and manage his time accordingly. This behavior is common as many people use calendars or planners to keep track of their appointments and commitments. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that if Max accepts an offer, he would mark it on his calendar to ensure he remembers and attends to it. \n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1617, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accepts sam offer then max needs to find the good offer.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max accepts Sam's offer, then Max needs to find the good offer\" suggests that Max would only accept Sam's offer if it is already a good one. It implies that after accepting the offer, Max would need to find a good offer, which is illogical because he would have already found and accepted it in the form of Sam's offer. Therefore, the statement is not common sense as it contains a redundancy and does not follow a logical sequence of actions. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 1618, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accepts sam offer then max thanks sam.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If max accepts sam offer then max thanks sam\" implies a social norm of expressing gratitude when someone accepts an offer made by another person. It is a common courtesy to thank someone who has extended an offer, as it shows appreciation for their gesture. This behavior is generally expected in most cultures as a way of acknowledging and valuing the other person's effort or kindness. \n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1619, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accepts sam offer then max wants to discuss with sam.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests a causal relationship between Max accepting Sam's offer and Max wanting to discuss with Sam. It is logical to assume that if Max accepts an offer from Sam, there would be details or aspects of the offer that Max would want to discuss or clarify with Sam. Accepting an offer usually implies some level of interest or agreement, which often leads to further discussion or communication. Therefore, it is reasonable to consider this statement as aligned with common sense.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1620, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accepts sam thanks then max feels happy.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max accepts Sam's thanks, then Max feels happy\" suggests a cause-and-effect relationship where Max's acceptance of gratitude leads to a feeling of happiness. This is based on the common understanding that receiving thanks or appreciation can positively affect one's emotions, leading to feelings of happiness and fulfillment. It is generally accepted that positive social interactions, such as expressions of gratitude, contribute to emotional well-being. Therefore, it seems reasonable to assume that accepting thanks could make Max feel happy, aligning with typical human emotional responses to positive acknowledgment.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1621, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accepts sam thanks then max gains friendship.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that accepting gratitude can lead to positive social outcomes, such as gaining friendship. In many social contexts, expressing and acknowledging gratitude is seen as a sign of good manners and can strengthen relationships. By accepting Sam's thanks, Max is likely to be perceived as gracious and considerate, which are qualities that can attract friendship. Therefore, the statement aligns with general social norms about polite behavior and relationship building.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1622, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accepts sam thanks then max is friendly.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max accepts Sam's thanks, then Max is friendly\" suggests that accepting gratitude is an indication of friendliness. While being polite and acknowledging thanks can be a component of a friendly demeanor, it alone does not necessarily define someone as friendly. Friendliness typically involves a broader range of behaviors and attitudes, such as being approachable, kind, and warm towards others. Therefore, accepting thanks could be just one aspect of being friendly, but it is not sufficient to conclude definitively that someone is friendly based solely on that action. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 1623, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accepts sam thanks then max is gracious.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max accepts Sam's thanks, then Max is gracious\" suggests that accepting thanks is a behavior associated with being gracious. Common sense would indicate that expressing gratitude and acknowledging someone's thanks is a polite and respectful behavior, which aligns with the characteristics of a gracious person. Therefore, accepting thanks can be seen as an action that supports the idea of being gracious.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1624, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accepts sam thanks then max is grateful.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max accepts Sam's thanks, then Max is grateful\" suggests a connection between accepting thanks and experiencing gratitude. Accepting thanks is a social behavior that can indicate acknowledgment and appreciation, which are components of gratitude. However, it is possible for someone to accept thanks outwardly as a polite gesture without genuinely feeling grateful internally. Therefore, the statement may not necessarily hold true in all cases, as outward behavior does not always reflect internal feelings.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1625, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accepts sam thanks then max is happy.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max accepts Sam's thanks, then Max is happy\" suggests a causality where Max's happiness is dependent on accepting gratitude from Sam. Common sense would dictate that happiness can be influenced by positive social interactions, such as expressions of gratitude. Accepting thanks may indicate that Max values the relationship and the recognition from Sam, which could contribute to his emotional well-being and happiness. However, it is also important to consider that happiness is subjective and can be influenced by various other factors not mentioned in the statement. Therefore, the statement might be an oversimplification but it aligns with common sense to some degree that positive interactions can lead to happiness.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1626, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accepts sam thanks then max is humble.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max accepts Sam's thanks, then Max is humble\" suggests that accepting gratitude is an indication of humility. While being gracious and acknowledging someone's appreciation can be seen as a humble act, it does not necessarily encompass the entirety of what it means to be humble. Humility involves a broader range of behaviors and attitudes, such as modesty, self-awareness, and putting others before oneself. Accepting thanks is just one possible manifestation of humility, but it is not sufficient to conclude definitively that someone is humble based solely on that action. Therefore, while the statement has some merit, it oversimplifies the concept of humility.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1627, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accepts sam thanks then max is polite.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max accepts Sam's thanks, then Max is polite\" suggests that accepting thanks is a behavior associated with politeness. In general, expressing gratitude and acknowledging it is considered a basic element of polite social interaction. Accepting thanks graciously shows respect and appreciation for the other person, which are key components of polite behavior. Therefore, the statement aligns with common social norms and expectations regarding politeness.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1628, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accepts sam thanks then max receives a verbal reward.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max accepts Sam's thanks then Max receives a verbal reward\" suggests a cause-and-effect relationship where Max's acceptance of gratitude leads to a verbal reward. In a typical social setting, accepting thanks is a polite and expected response, but it does not necessarily guarantee a verbal reward. The outcome depends on the context and the individuals involved. Verbal rewards are often given for actions that go beyond basic social etiquette, such as exceptional help or kindness. Therefore, the statement assumes a specific scenario that may not be universally applicable or considered common sense in all situations.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1629, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accepts sam thanks then max thinks more of sam.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests a causal relationship between Max accepting Sam's thanks and Max's opinion of Sam improving. However, accepting thanks is a common courtesy and doesn't necessarily indicate a change in opinion or deeper appreciation. It's possible for Max to accept Sam's thanks politely without it affecting his overall opinion of Sam. Therefore, the statement assumes a connection that may not universally hold true.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1630, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accepts sam thanks then max wants to relax.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If max accepts sam thanks then max wants to relax\" does not necessarily follow common sense as there is no clear logical connection between accepting thanks from someone named Sam and wanting to relax. Accepting thanks is a social interaction that does not inherently lead to a desire to relax. The desire to relax could be influenced by many other factors unrelated to the interaction with Sam. Therefore, the statement does not inherently align with common sense based on the provided information. \n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1631, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accepts sam thanks then sam agree with one another.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max accepts Sam's thanks then Sam agrees with one another\" seems to be lacking clarity and coherence in its logical structure. It suggests a cause-and-effect relationship between Max accepting thanks and Sam agreeing with themselves or others, which does not follow a typical logical pattern. Additionally, the use of \"one another\" implies multiple people, but \"Sam\" appears to refer to a single person, making the statement confusing. \n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1632, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accepts sam thanks then sam has self respect.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If max accepts sam thanks then sam has self respect\" does not necessarily align with common sense, as accepting thanks and having self-respect are not directly correlated. Accepting thanks is a social interaction that involves gratitude and acknowledgment, while self-respect refers to an individual's perception of their own worth and dignity. These are separate concepts and one does not necessarily lead to or imply the other. Therefore, the statement does not logically follow common sense reasoning.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1633, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accepts sam thanks then sam wants to help him.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests a causal relationship between Max accepting Sam's thanks and Sam's desire to help him. It implies that Sam's willingness to help is contingent on Max's acceptance of gratitude, which may not necessarily align with common sense. Common sense would suggest that Sam\u2019s desire to help should be motivated by factors such as empathy, kindness, or a sense of duty, rather than being conditional on receiving thanks. Therefore, the statement does not align with typical reasoning about helping behavior.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1634, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accepts sam's apology then max feels good.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max accepts Sam's apology then Max feels good\" suggests that accepting an apology leads to positive emotions. Generally, when someone accepts an apology, it implies forgiveness and a resolution of conflict, which can lead to feelings of relief and happiness. Thus, it makes sense that accepting an apology could make Max feel good as it indicates moving past the issue and restoring harmony. However, it's important to note that this isn't always the case as the emotional response can vary based on the severity of the situation and the relationship between the individuals. Despite this, the general idea that accepting an apology can lead to positive feelings is a reasonable assumption. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1635, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accepts sam's apology then max intends to to be generous.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max accepts Sam's apology, then Max intends to be generous\" suggests a connection between acceptance of an apology and an intention of generosity. Common sense might indicate that accepting an apology could be linked to forgiveness or reconciliation, but it does not necessarily imply an intention to be generous. Generosity often involves going beyond basic forgiveness to offer something more, which may not always be the case in accepting an apology. Thus, the statement assumes a specific motivation (generosity) that is not inherently tied to the act of accepting an apology in all situations.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1636, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accepts sam's apology then max is forgiving.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If max accepts sam's apology then max is forgiving\" suggests that accepting an apology is an indication of forgiveness. This is a common understanding in interpersonal relationships, as accepting an apology generally implies that one has moved past the grievance and is willing to reconcile. It demonstrates a willingness to let go of resentment and give the other person another chance, which are key aspects of forgiveness. Therefore, accepting an apology can be seen as an act of forgiveness.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1637, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accepts sam's apology then max is frank.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If max accepts sam's apology then max is frank\" does not necessarily align with common sense, as accepting an apology does not inherently relate to or determine someone's identity or name. The statement appears to be a non-sequitur, meaning the conclusion does not logically follow from the premise. Accepting an apology is a behavioral action and does not dictate or reveal the identity of a person named Frank. Therefore, the statement does not make logical or common sense based on the information provided.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1638, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accepts sam's apology then max they talk to sam more.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max accepts Sam's apology, then Max will talk to Sam more\" is based on the assumption that accepting an apology generally leads to an improvement in a relationship. When someone accepts another's apology, it indicates a willingness to move past the issue and restore positive communication. As a result, it is reasonable to expect that Max would be more open to engaging in conversations with Sam, leading to an increase in their communication. \n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1639, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accepts sam's apology then max wants to forgive.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max accepts Sam's apology then Max wants to forgive\" is based on the idea that accepting an apology generally indicates a willingness or desire to forgive. When someone accepts an apology, it usually means they are ready to move past the conflict or hurt caused by the other person. Acceptance of an apology often implies a desire to mend the relationship and let go of negative feelings, which is essentially what forgiveness entails. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that if Max accepts Sam's apology, it indicates Max's intention or desire to forgive Sam.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1640, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accepts sam's apology then max wants to move on.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that if Max accepts Sam's apology, it implies that Max is willing to put the past conflict behind and move forward in their relationship. Accepting an apology typically indicates a readiness to forgive and let go of any negative feelings associated with the incident. It demonstrates a desire to restore harmony and move past the issue, rather than holding onto grudges or resentment. Therefore, accepting an apology can often be seen as an indication that the person wants to move on.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1641, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accepts sam's apology then sam settle the score.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests a causal relationship where Max's acceptance of Sam's apology leads to Sam settling the score. It assumes that accepting an apology inherently resolves a conflict or disagreement, which may not always be the case. Accepting an apology is a step towards reconciliation, but it does not guarantee that the underlying issues have been fully addressed or that the score has been settled. Other factors such as the nature of the conflict, the sincerity of the apology, and the willingness of both parties to move forward play crucial roles. Therefore, the statement oversimplifies the dynamics of conflict resolution.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1642, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accepts sam's apology then sam wants to move on.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests a causal relationship between Max accepting Sam's apology and Sam's desire to move forward. It indicates that Sam's willingness to move on is contingent on receiving forgiveness from Max. This assumption makes sense in the context of interpersonal relationships, where resolving conflicts and receiving forgiveness can be important for emotional closure and moving forward. Therefore, the statement aligns with common sense as it reflects a common emotional response in similar situations.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1643, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accepts sam's invitation then max feels included.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max accepts Sam's invitation then Max feels included\" suggests a causality where accepting an invitation leads to feeling included. In many social contexts, accepting an invitation can indeed lead to feelings of inclusion, as it typically means participating in a group activity, being acknowledged, and having a sense of belonging. However, the statement might not hold true universally as the feeling of inclusion can be subjective and depend on other factors such as the nature of the event, the existing relationship between individuals, and personal insecurities or perceptions. Despite these nuances, the general link between acceptance of an invitation and feeling included holds in most typical scenarios.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1644, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accepts sam's invitation then max gets thanked.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement is based on social norms and manners, where it's common for someone to thank another person for accepting an invitation as a gesture of appreciation. This is generally expected behavior in many cultures to show gratitude. Therefore, the statement aligns with what is commonly anticipated in social interactions.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1645, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accepts sam's invitation then max is loved.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If max accepts sam's invitation then max is loved\" is not necessarily common sense. Accepting an invitation does not inherently imply that someone is loved. Max might accept the invitation for various reasons, such as politeness, interest in the event, or a desire to maintain a friendship, none of which directly equate to being loved. The relationship between accepting an invitation and being loved is not a direct or guaranteed correlation. \n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1646, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accepts sam's invitation then max is social.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max accepts Sam's invitation then Max is social\" suggests that accepting an invitation is an indicator of being social. While accepting an invitation can be a sign of sociability, it is not the sole determinant. Being social involves a broader range of behaviors and interactions, such as engaging with others, participating in conversations, and showing interest in forming connections. Accepting an invitation could be influenced by other factors such as obligation, interest in the event, or personal relationships, rather than an inherent sociability. Therefore, the statement might be an oversimplification.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1647, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accepts sam's invitation then max wants show up in the event.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement implies a cause-and-effect relationship where accepting an invitation leads to a commitment to attend the event. Common sense suggests that if someone accepts an invitation, it typically indicates their intention and desire to be present at the event unless unforeseen circumstances prevent them from doing so. Therefore, the statement aligns with general expectations of social behavior and commitment.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1648, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accepts sam's invitation then sam feels glad.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max accepts Sam's invitation then Sam feels glad\" is based on the idea that when someone's invitation is accepted, it generally leads to positive feelings because it signals acceptance and agreement. Accepting an invitation indicates that the person values the relationship and is interested in participating in the event or activity proposed. This can naturally lead to feelings of happiness and gladness in the person who extended the invitation. Therefore, it can be considered a common-sense assumption that Sam would feel glad if Max accepts the invitation.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1649, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accepts sam's invitation then sam smiles.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max accepts Sam's invitation then Sam smiles\" implies a cause-and-effect relationship where Sam's happiness (smiling) is contingent upon Max accepting his invitation. This makes sense as accepting an invitation can be seen as a positive response and could naturally lead to Sam feeling happy or pleased. Therefore, it is reasonable to say that the statement aligns with common sense, as it reflects a typical human emotional response to social interactions.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1650, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accepts sam's invitation then sam spends time with max.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests a causal relationship between Max accepting Sam's invitation and Sam spending time with Max. It is reasonable to assume that if Max accepts an invitation from Sam, it implies that Max intends to participate in the planned activity, which would naturally lead to Sam spending time with Max. This is a common social scenario where accepting an invitation leads to spending time together. Therefore, it aligns with general expectations and social norms.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1651, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accepts sam's offer then max accepts the money.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max accepts Sam's offer then Max accepts the money\" seems to suggest a conditional relationship where accepting the offer is directly linked to accepting the money. This implies that Sam's offer includes a monetary component. If that is the case, accepting the offer would naturally involve accepting the money associated with it. Therefore, it seems logical and common sense to assume that if Max accepts the offer, he is also accepting the money that comes with it. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1652, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accepts sam's offer then max goes over the agreement.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max accepts Sam's offer then Max goes over the agreement\" implies a cause-and-effect relationship between accepting an offer and reviewing an agreement. However, without additional context about the nature of the offer or the agreement, it's unclear whether it is common sense to assume that accepting an offer would necessarily lead to reviewing an agreement. In many situations, accepting an offer might be contingent upon prior knowledge or understanding of an agreement, not necessarily followed by reviewing it. Therefore, this statement does not universally hold as common sense without further context. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 1653, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accepts sam's offer then max intends to to move past disagreement.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement implies that Max's acceptance of Sam's offer is an indication of his intention to move past a disagreement. In many cases, accepting an offer can suggest a willingness to reconcile and find common ground, as it often involves compromise and cooperation. This can be seen as a step towards resolving conflicts and moving forward in a positive direction. However, it's important to note that this isn't necessarily always the case, as the specifics of the offer and the nature of the disagreement play crucial roles in determining Max's intentions.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1654, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accepts sam's offer then max intends to to obtain something.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max accepts Sam's offer, then Max intends to obtain something\" is based on the understanding that accepting an offer typically implies a desire or intention to gain or benefit from what is being offered. In this context, Max's acceptance suggests that he sees value in Sam's offer and intends to obtain something, whether it be a tangible item, a service, or some form of advantage. This aligns with common sense, as people generally accept offers with the intention of receiving something in return.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1655, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accepts sam's offer then max is amicable.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max accepts Sam's offer then Max is amicable\" is contingent upon the nature of the offer and the relationship between Max and Sam. The term \"amicable\" implies friendliness and agreeableness. Accepting an offer could be seen as a gesture of goodwill or cooperation, which may suggest amicability. However, without further context about the offer and the circumstances under which it is made, it is difficult to definitively conclude that accepting an offer alone equates to being amicable. Other factors, such as the motives behind the acceptance or the broader relationship dynamics, could influence whether accepting an offer is indeed a sign of amicability.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1656, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accepts sam's offer then max is considerate.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max accepts Sam's offer then Max is considerate\" is contingent upon the nature of Sam's offer and the circumstances surrounding it. The statement implies a cause-and-effect relationship, suggesting that Max's acceptance of the offer is a direct indication of his considerateness. However, without knowing the specifics of the offer, it is difficult to determine whether accepting it would indeed be a considerate action. Being considerate generally involves being thoughtful and showing concern for others, but the offer itself may or may not provide an opportunity for Max to demonstrate these qualities. Therefore, without additional context, it is not necessarily common sense to assume that accepting any offer would automatically make Max considerate. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 1657, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accepts sam's offer then max is friendly.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If max accepts sam's offer then max is friendly\" suggests a correlation between accepting an offer and being friendly. However, accepting an offer could be influenced by various factors such as politeness, necessity, or personal gain, rather than just friendliness. Additionally, someone can be unfriendly or neutral and still accept an offer for reasons unrelated to their disposition towards friendliness. Therefore, accepting an offer is not a definitive indicator of friendliness.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1658, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accepts sam's offer then max is trusting.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "Accepting someone's offer generally implies a level of trust in the person making the offer, as it involves believing in the integrity and reliability of the offeror. In this specific statement, if Max accepts Sam's offer, it suggests that Max has confidence in Sam's intentions and the terms of the offer. This trust could be based on previous experiences, the nature of the relationship, or the credibility of the offer itself.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1659, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accepts sam's offer then max shakes hands.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If max accepts sam's offer then max shakes hands\" is not necessarily common sense, as it is dependent on the context and cultural norms. In some cultures or situations, shaking hands is a common way to signify acceptance of an offer or agreement, but in others, it may not be the norm. Additionally, the nature of the offer or the relationship between Max and Sam could also influence whether shaking hands is an appropriate or expected response. Without more information about the context, it is not possible to definitively say that this statement is common sense. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 1660, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accepts sam's offer then max wants to pay money.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests a causal relationship between Max accepting Sam's offer and Max's desire to pay money. It assumes that accepting an offer inherently involves a willingness or desire to provide payment. In typical scenarios where offers are made, such as in business transactions or agreements for services, acceptance of the offer usually implies that the acceptor is ready to fulfill their part of the agreement, which often includes monetary payment. Therefore, it can be considered common sense that if Max accepts an offer, he is prepared to pay money as part of the acceptance. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1661, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accepts sam's offer then sam feels relieved.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max accepts Sam's offer then Sam feels relieved\" suggests a cause-and-effect relationship where Sam's relief is contingent upon Max's acceptance of the offer. This makes sense as accepting an offer typically alleviates the uncertainty and anxiety experienced by the person who made the offer. Sam is likely to feel relieved because the acceptance signifies a positive outcome or resolution to the situation that prompted the offer in the first place.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1662, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accepts sam's offer then sam feels satisfied.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max accepts Sam's offer then Sam feels satisfied\" suggests a cause-and-effect relationship where Sam's satisfaction is contingent upon Max accepting his offer. This implies that Sam's offer is important to him and that he values Max's acceptance, which would likely lead to feelings of satisfaction or fulfillment. This is a logical and reasonable assumption, as people commonly feel satisfied when their propositions or requests are accepted by others.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1663, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accepts sam's offer then sam smiles.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max accepts Sam's offer then Sam smiles\" implies a cause-and-effect relationship where Sam's happiness is contingent on Max's acceptance of an offer. This suggests that the offer is important or desirable to Sam, and receiving acceptance from Max leads to a positive emotional response. It is common for people to feel happy or satisfied when their proposals or offers are accepted by others, as it often signifies approval, agreement, or the anticipation of a positive outcome. Therefore, the statement aligns with typical human behavior and emotional responses in social interactions.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1664, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accepts sam's offer then sam wants to hand over the goods.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max accepts Sam's offer then Sam wants to hand over the goods\" suggests a logical progression of events in a transaction. When Max accepts Sam's offer, it implies that they have reached an agreement, and the next step would typically be for Sam to fulfill his part of the agreement by handing over the goods. This aligns with common expectations in transactions where acceptance of an offer leads to the execution of the agreed terms. Therefore, it makes sense that Sam would want to hand over the goods following Max's acceptance as it completes the transaction process. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1665, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accepts sam's offer then sam wants to take the money.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max accepts Sam's offer then Sam wants to take the money\" involves assumptions about the motivations and intentions of the individuals involved. It suggests that Sam's desire to take the money is contingent upon Max's acceptance of the offer. However, it's possible that Sam's wanting to take the money is independent of Max's actions and depends more on Sam's initial reasons for making the offer. Without additional context, it's difficult to determine whether Sam's wanting to take the money is directly caused by Max's acceptance. The statement does not necessarily align with common sense as it assumes a direct cause-effect relationship without considering other factors influencing Sam's intentions.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1666, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accepts sam's offer then sam wants to thank max.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests a causal relationship between Max accepting Sam's offer and Sam wanting to express gratitude. It is generally considered polite and socially appropriate to thank someone who has agreed to a proposal or offer, as it indicates appreciation for the other person's cooperation or agreement. In many cultures, expressing thanks in such a scenario is seen as common courtesy.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1667, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accepts sam's proposal then max earns some money.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max accepts Sam's proposal then Max earns some money\" seems to suggest a scenario where Max accepting the proposal is linked to some financial gain. This could be a business deal, investment opportunity, or partnership where acceptance leads to profit. Without additional context, it's reasonable to assume that Sam's proposal involves a financial benefit for Max, which makes the statement plausible. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1668, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accepts sam's proposal then max feels thrilled.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If max accepts sam's proposal then max feels thrilled\" suggests a causality where accepting the proposal leads to Max feeling thrilled. This implies that the proposal is something desirable or positive for Max, making the feeling of thrill a natural and expected response. Generally, accepting proposals that are appealing or beneficial tends to result in positive emotions such as happiness or excitement. However, without additional context about the nature of the proposal or Max's personal circumstances and preferences, it is an assumption to universally declare that acceptance will lead to thrill. Despite this, based on common human emotions in response to favorable outcomes, it is reasonable to align with the idea presented in the statement. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1669, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accepts sam's proposal then max intends to to move on with the project.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max accepts Sam's proposal then Max intends to move on with the project\" suggests a logical progression in a professional or collaborative context. Accepting a proposal generally implies agreement with its terms and a readiness to proceed with the associated actions or tasks. Therefore, if Max accepts Sam's proposal, it is reasonable to infer that Max intends to advance with the project outlined in the proposal.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1670, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accepts sam's proposal then max is amenable.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max accepts Sam's proposal then Max is amenable\" suggests that Max's acceptance of the proposal indicates a willingness or openness to agree, which is the definition of being amenable. In everyday language, agreeing to a proposal generally implies a level of cooperation or agreeableness. Therefore, it is logical to deduce that if Max accepts the proposal, he is demonstrating an amenable attitude. \n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1671, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accepts sam's proposal then max is cooperative.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If max accepts sam's proposal then max is cooperative\" suggests that accepting a proposal is an indication of cooperation. This is based on the idea that accepting a proposal often involves working together, compromising, and contributing to a mutual goal, which are key elements of cooperation. Therefore, if Max accepts Sam's proposal, it can be seen as Max being willing to collaborate and engage in a joint effort, which aligns with the definition of being cooperative.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1672, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accepts sam's proposal then max is trusting.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If max accepts sam's proposal then max is trusting\" suggests that accepting a proposal implies trust in the person making the proposal. This makes sense because accepting a proposal often involves believing in the credibility, reliability, or competence of the proposer. Trust is a key component in most agreements or collaborations. Therefore, it is reasonable to say that if Max accepts Sam's proposal, it implies that Max trusts Sam to some extent.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1673, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accepts sam's proposal then max needs to fall in love.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max accepts Sam's proposal then Max needs to fall in love\" suggests a causal relationship between accepting a proposal and falling in love. However, accepting a proposal does not necessarily mean that Max is already in love or needs to fall in love immediately. People might accept proposals for various reasons, such as feeling pressured, wanting to give the relationship a chance to grow, or hoping love will develop over time. Thus, the statement does not necessarily align with common sense, as it assumes that love must already be present or inevitably follow after accepting a proposal.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1674, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accepts sam's proposal then max needs to propose.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max accepts Sam's proposal then Max needs to propose\" seems logically inconsistent. Accepting a proposal implies that the proposal has already been made by someone else, in this case, Sam. If Max is accepting Sam's proposal, it means that Sam has already proposed and Max is merely responding to Sam's proposal, not making a new one. Therefore, it does not make common sense for Max to need to propose after accepting Sam's proposal.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1675, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accepts sam's proposal then max wants to get married.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max accepts Sam's proposal then Max wants to get married\" makes a logical assumption based on the context of accepting a marriage proposal. Generally, accepting a marriage proposal implies a desire to get married, as the acceptance indicates agreement and readiness for that commitment. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that if Max accepts the proposal, it suggests Max has an intention or desire to get married. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1676, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accepts sam's proposal then sam get's a receipt.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max accepts Sam's proposal then Sam gets a receipt\" suggests a cause-and-effect relationship where acceptance of a proposal leads to the issuance of a receipt. In many real-world scenarios, such as business transactions, contracts, or agreements, it is common practice to provide a receipt or some form of written acknowledgment once an offer or proposal is accepted as proof of agreement. This helps to ensure clarity and accountability between the parties involved. Therefore, the statement aligns with typical procedural norms in various professional and personal interactions.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1677, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accepts sam's proposal then sam signs the paper.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max accepts Sam's proposal then Sam signs the paper\" is contingent upon the specific context and the nature of the proposal and paper being referenced. If the proposal is an agreement or contract that requires Sam's signature upon acceptance, it follows logically that Sam would sign the paper if Max accepts the proposal. This would make the statement a common-sense conclusion based on the assumed conditions of a formal agreement process.\n\nHowever, without additional context specifying the type of proposal and the paper's relevance, it is difficult to determine if this statement universally applies as common sense across all scenarios.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1678, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accepts sam's proposal then sam wants to marry sam.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max accepts Sam's proposal then Sam wants to marry Sam\" appears to contain a logical error or typo. It suggests that Sam wants to marry themself, which is unusual and likely not the intended meaning. Typically, a marriage proposal involves two different individuals agreeing to marry each other. Therefore, the statement does not align with common sense as it is likely meant to convey that \"If Max accepts Sam's proposal, then Sam wants to marry Max.\"\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1679, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accepts sam's resignation then max feels sad.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If max accepts sam's resignation then max feels sad\" suggests a cause-and-effect relationship where Max's acceptance of Sam's resignation leads to Max feeling sad. This could be common sense if we assume that Max values Sam's contributions and presence in the workplace, making the resignation a loss for Max. The emotional response of sadness upon losing a valued colleague or employee is a natural human reaction. However, without additional context about the nature of their relationship or the circumstances around the resignation, it's difficult to definitively say that this is always the case. Nonetheless, based on typical human emotions in similar situations, it's reasonable to consider this statement as aligning with common sense. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1680, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accepts sam's resignation then max intends to to be sincere.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max accepts Sam's resignation, then Max intends to be sincere\" suggests a connection between Max's acceptance of the resignation and his intention to be sincere. In typical scenarios, when someone accepts a resignation, it is generally expected that they do so in good faith and with sincerity, acknowledging the decision of the person resigning. The act of accepting a resignation usually implies that the person doing so recognizes and respects the decision, which aligns with being sincere about the process. Therefore, the statement aligns with common sense expectations of sincerity in professional interactions.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1681, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accepts sam's resignation then max is saddened.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If max accepts sam's resignation then max is saddened\" implies a cause-and-effect relationship where accepting a resignation leads to sadness. This could be common sense if we assume that Max values Sam's contributions and presence in the workplace, and that losing a valuable team member would naturally cause sadness. However, without knowing the specifics of their relationship or circumstances, it's not possible to definitively say that accepting the resignation always leads to sadness. Yet, in many typical scenarios where a valued team member resigns, it is reasonable to expect feelings of sadness in response to their departure. \n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1682, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accepts sam's resignation then max wants dismiss sam.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max accepts Sam's resignation then Max wants to dismiss Sam\" may not necessarily be common sense. Accepting a resignation and wanting to dismiss someone are two different actions with different implications. When someone resigns, it is typically a voluntary decision made by the employee to leave their position. If Max accepts Sam's resignation, it simply means that Max acknowledges and agrees to Sam's decision to leave. On the other hand, wanting to dismiss someone implies that Max desires to terminate Sam's employment, which is not necessarily related to Sam's voluntary resignation. Therefore, the statement may not reflect a logical or common sense connection between accepting a resignation and wanting to dismiss someone.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1683, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accepts sam's resignation then max wants hire the replacment.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max accepts Sam's resignation then Max wants to hire the replacement\" implies a causal relationship between accepting a resignation and wanting to hire a replacement. In many real-world scenarios, when a manager or employer accepts an employee's resignation, it is often necessary to find a replacement to fill the vacant position and ensure the continuity of work. However, the statement does not necessarily hold true in all cases, as there might be situations where the position is being eliminated, or the responsibilities are being redistributed among existing staff, or there might be a hiring freeze. Thus, while it is common for an employer to want to hire a replacement after accepting a resignation, it is not universally true that they always want to.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1684, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accepts sam's resignation then sam get's to retire.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max accepts Sam's resignation then Sam gets to retire\" implies a cause-and-effect relationship where Max's acceptance of Sam's resignation leads to Sam's retirement. In many workplaces, accepting a resignation is a formal acknowledgment that an employee is leaving their position, which could be due to retirement. Therefore, if Sam's reason for resigning is to retire, and Max accepts the resignation, then it follows logically that Sam would retire.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1685, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accepts sam's resignation then sam wants curse max out.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that if Max accepts Sam's resignation, then Sam would want to curse Max out. This does not align with common sense as typically, when someone resigns from a job, it is a decision they have made willingly and it would not be logical for them to be angry or resentful towards the person accepting their resignation. In fact, accepting a resignation is generally a neutral or even supportive action, not one that would provoke hostility.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1686, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accepts sam's resignation then sam wants search for a new job.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement implies that Sam will need to find a new job if Max, presumably his current employer, accepts his resignation. This is a logical consequence because resigning from a job means leaving the current position, and searching for a new job would be a necessary step to maintain income and continue one's career. Therefore, the statement aligns with common sense expectations about the consequences of resigning from a job. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1687, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accepts the challenge then max becomes motivated.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max accepts the challenge then Max becomes motivated\" implies a cause-and-effect relationship where accepting a challenge leads to increased motivation. In many cases, accepting a challenge can indeed lead to motivation, as individuals may feel driven to overcome obstacles and achieve their goals. This can be especially true if the challenge aligns with personal interests or offers a potential reward. However, motivation can be influenced by various factors such as individual personality, the nature of the challenge, and external support, so it is not guaranteed in every case. Nevertheless, the statement aligns with a common psychological response where challenges can stimulate motivation. \n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1688, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accepts the challenge then max competes.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max accepts the challenge then Max competes\" implies a logical progression of events where accepting a challenge leads to competing in it. This is a common understanding because accepting a challenge generally means committing to participate in the activities or tasks associated with that challenge. Therefore, it makes sense that if Max agrees to take on a challenge, he will follow through by competing in it. This aligns with typical expectations and behaviors in situations involving challenges and competitions.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1689, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accepts the challenge then max feels nervous.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max accepts the challenge then Max feels nervous\" implies a cause-and-effect relationship between accepting a challenge and feeling nervous. It is common for individuals to experience nervousness when faced with challenges, as challenges often involve uncertainty, risk, and the potential for failure. Feeling nervous can be a natural human response to these factors as it indicates a level of concern or anxiety about the outcome. Therefore, it is reasonable to consider this statement as aligning with common sense.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1690, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accepts the challenge then max is apprehensive.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max accepts the challenge then Max is apprehensive\" suggests that accepting a challenge is associated with feeling apprehensive or anxious. This is a plausible scenario because accepting a challenge often involves facing uncertainty, risks, or potential difficulties, which can naturally lead to feelings of apprehension. However, it is not universally true as some individuals may feel excited, confident, or motivated instead of apprehensive when accepting a challenge. Therefore, the statement might be true in some cases, but not in others, depending on Max's personality, experience, and the nature of the challenge.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1691, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accepts the challenge then max is brave.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max accepts the challenge then Max is brave\" implies a cause-and-effect relationship where accepting a challenge is indicative of bravery. In many contexts, accepting challenges can be seen as an act of courage because it involves facing fears, uncertainties, or difficulties. Bravery is often characterized by the willingness to confront such situations. However, the statement does not account for the nature of the challenge or Max's motivations and circumstances, which could influence whether the act is truly brave or not. Therefore, the statement might be an oversimplification but broadly aligns with a common understanding of bravery.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1692, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accepts the challenge then max joins the competition.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max accepts the challenge then Max joins the competition\" suggests a cause-and-effect relationship where accepting the challenge leads to participating in the competition. This could be considered common sense if accepting the challenge inherently means agreeing to compete, as challenges are often directly related to competitions in many contexts. However, without further context about the nature of the challenge or the rules of the competition, it is difficult to definitively say that this is always the case. Nonetheless, in many typical scenarios, accepting a challenge would logically lead to participation in the associated competition. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1693, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accepts the challenge then max needs to be presenting with it.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max accepts the challenge then Max needs to be presenting with it\" suggests that if Max agrees to take on a challenge, he must be actively engaged and involved in addressing it. This is logical as accepting a challenge generally implies a willingness to participate and take responsibility for handling the task at hand. Therefore, the statement aligns with common sense expectations of commitment and engagement when one agrees to a challenge.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1694, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accepts the challenge then max wants to success.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max accepts the challenge then Max wants to succeed\" suggests that accepting a challenge implies a desire to achieve success. This makes sense as accepting a challenge typically indicates a willingness to put forth effort and overcome obstacles to reach a goal. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that if someone accepts a challenge, they do so with the intention of succeeding at it. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1695, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accepts the challenge then sam feels glad.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max accepts the challenge then Sam feels glad\" implies a cause-and-effect relationship between Max accepting a challenge and Sam's emotional response. This statement could be common sense if there is a known context where Sam has a vested interest in Max accepting challenges, such as a coach-player relationship, friendship, or mentorship. However, without additional context about the relationship between Max and Sam or the nature of the challenge, it is difficult to definitively say that this is a common-sense statement as it could vary based on individual circumstances and personal connections. Therefore, without more information, we cannot assume it to be common sense universally.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1696, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accepts the dare then max becomes brave.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max accepts the dare then Max becomes brave\" implies a direct correlation between accepting a dare and becoming brave. However, bravery is a complex trait that can be influenced by a variety of factors, including past experiences, personal values, and individual fear responses. Accepting a dare might demonstrate a moment of courage, but it does not necessarily equate to an overall increase in bravery. True bravery often involves thoughtful decision-making and facing fears in a constructive manner, rather than taking risks for the sake of a dare. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 1697, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accepts the dare then max does something crazy.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If max accepts the dare then max does something crazy\" suggests a cause-and-effect relationship where accepting a dare leads to doing something crazy. This statement could be considered common sense if we assume that the nature of the dare is extreme or unconventional, as dares often are. However, the statement might not hold true if the dare is relatively tame or ordinary. Therefore, whether or not this statement is common sense depends on the context of the dare. But generally, dares are understood to push boundaries or encourage risky behavior, which aligns with doing something crazy. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1698, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accepts the dare then max feels anxious.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max accepts the dare then Max feels anxious\" implies a cause-and-effect relationship between accepting a dare and feeling anxious. Accepting a dare often involves taking on a challenge that may be risky or outside of one's comfort zone, which can naturally lead to feelings of anxiety due to fear of potential consequences or failure. Feeling anxious in such situations is a common human response as it involves uncertainty and potential risk. Therefore, the statement aligns with common human emotional responses in challenging situations. \n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1699, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accepts the dare then max feels brave.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max accepts the dare then Max feels brave\" implies a cause-and-effect relationship where accepting a dare leads to feeling brave. In many cases, accepting a dare can be a result of feeling brave already, or it can lead to feeling brave as a result of conquering fear. However, it's also possible for someone to accept a dare due to peer pressure, curiosity, or other reasons without necessarily feeling brave. Therefore, the statement doesn't universally hold true as it depends on the individual's motivation and emotional response. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 1700, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accepts the dare then max feels nervous.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max accepts the dare then Max feels nervous\" implies a cause-and-effect relationship where accepting a dare leads to feelings of nervousness. It is common for individuals to feel nervous when faced with challenging, risky, or unfamiliar situations, such as a dare, due to the anticipation of potential consequences or the pressure to perform. This emotional response can be a natural reaction to stepping out of one's comfort zone. Therefore, the statement aligns with a typical human emotional response in such scenarios.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1701, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accepts the dare then max intends to to prove they are not afraid.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max accepts the dare then Max intends to prove they are not afraid\" suggests a motive behind accepting the dare, which is to demonstrate courage or lack of fear. In many social contexts, dares are often associated with testing one's bravery or pushing one's limits. Therefore, when someone accepts a dare, it's commonly perceived that they are doing so to show they are not scared, whether to themselves or to others watching.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that the statement might not always hold true as people might accept dares for various other reasons such as peer pressure, for fun, or to be part of a group, which are not necessarily about proving they are not afraid. Despite these possibilities, the statement aligns with a general understanding of why people typically accept dares.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1702, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accepts the dare then max is risky.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max accepts the dare then Max is risky\" implies a direct correlation between accepting a dare and exhibiting risky behavior. Accepting a dare often involves taking on a challenge that may have uncertain outcomes or potential consequences, which aligns with the characteristics of risky behavior. Risky behavior is generally defined as actions that expose an individual to danger or significant chances of negative consequences. Therefore, if Max willingly accepts a dare, it can be indicative of his willingness to engage in such behaviors, supporting the idea that he is indeed taking a risk.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1703, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accepts the dare then max is willing.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max accepts the dare then Max is willing\" implies a logical connection between accepting a dare and being willing to do what the dare entails. Common sense suggests that if someone voluntarily agrees to do something, like accepting a dare, they are generally willing to follow through with the action. Therefore, the statement aligns with common sense that accepting a dare indicates a level of willingness to participate in the challenge presented by the dare.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1704, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accepts the dare then max needs to be challenged.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests a causal relationship between Max accepting a dare and needing to be challenged. It implies that accepting a dare indicates a readiness or desire for a challenge. This can be a common perspective, as accepting a dare often involves stepping out of one's comfort zone or taking on a task that may require courage or determination. However, the necessity of being challenged just because one accepts a dare is subjective and depends on individual motivations and circumstances. Nevertheless, the statement aligns with the general idea that taking on a dare can be seen as embracing a challenge. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1705, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accepts the dare then max performs dare.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max accepts the dare then Max performs the dare\" implies that accepting the dare leads to the completion of the dare. This suggests a causal relationship where accepting the dare is a commitment to follow through with the action. In general, accepting a challenge or dare typically implies the intention to carry it out, so it aligns with common expectations and social norms. Therefore, the statement can be considered to reflect common sense, as it describes a typical and expected behavior.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1706, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accepts the dare then max wants get out of it.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that if Max accepts a dare, he immediately wants to get out of it. This implies that Max may have regrets or second thoughts after accepting the dare. However, it is not necessarily true that everyone who accepts a dare automatically wants to get out of it. Some people may accept dares because they genuinely want to participate in the challenge or for other personal reasons. Therefore, the statement cannot be considered common sense as it doesn't apply universally to all situations or individuals. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 1707, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accepts the dare then max wants to complate the dare.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max accepts the dare then Max wants to complete the dare\" implies that accepting the dare indicates a willingness or desire to follow through with it. In general, when someone accepts a challenge or task, it is usually because they have some level of interest or motivation to complete it. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that if Max accepts the dare, he likely has some inclination or desire to complete it, making the statement align with common sense. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1708, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accepts the dare then max wants to gain respect.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max accepts the dare then Max wants to gain respect\" suggests a motivation behind Max's decision to accept the dare. It implies that Max's acceptance of the dare is driven by a desire to be respected or admired by others. This could be considered common sense as it is a common human behavior to seek approval and respect from peers, especially in situations that involve taking risks or challenges. Accepting a dare can be seen as a way to prove oneself and gain social standing.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1709, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accepts the dare then sam feels amused.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max accepts the dare then Sam feels amused\" is not necessarily common sense because it assumes a specific emotional reaction from Sam without considering other possibilities or individual differences in how people respond to dares. The statement presupposes that Sam finds dares amusing, but it is possible that Sam could feel concerned, indifferent, or have a different reaction entirely. Additionally, the statement doesn't take into account the nature of the dare or the relationship between Max and Sam, which could influence Sam's feelings. Therefore, the statement is not universally applicable or predictable based on common sense alone.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1710, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accepts the dare then sam gives max a high five.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max accepts the dare then Sam gives Max a high five\" suggests a causal relationship between accepting a dare and receiving a high five as a form of celebration or encouragement. This kind of behavior is commonly observed among friends and peers, especially in informal or casual settings where dares and physical gestures like high fives are used to express camaraderie, support, or approval. However, whether or not this statement is considered common sense can depend on the cultural and social context, as well as the relationship between Max and Sam. In many contexts, it would be reasonable to expect a high five after accepting a dare, as it is a typical way to acknowledge someone's bravery or willingness to participate in a challenge. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1711, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accepts the dare then sam wants watch max do it.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that if Max accepts a dare, Sam is interested in watching Max perform it. This could be considered common sense in certain contexts, as it is not unusual for people to be curious or entertained by watching others take on challenges or dares. Observing someone else's daring actions can be thrilling or amusing, which might explain Sam's interest in watching Max. However, without more information about the relationship between Max and Sam or the nature of the dare, it's not definitive that this would always be the case. Nonetheless, considering general human behavior and curiosity, it's reasonable to think that Sam would want to watch Max.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1712, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accepts the fact then max feels accepting.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max accepts the fact then Max feels accepting\" implies a logical progression of emotional response based on cognitive acceptance. Accepting a fact logically suggests a level of agreement or acknowledgement of the truth, which can lead to a feeling of acceptance emotionally. This connection between cognitive acceptance and emotional response is generally supported by common psychological understanding of how beliefs and emotions are interconnected. Therefore, it appears to be common sense that if Max cognitively accepts something as true, it is likely to influence his emotional state towards acceptance.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1713, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accepts the fact then max feels agreeable.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If max accepts the fact then max feels agreeable\" suggests that accepting a fact leads to a feeling of agreeableness. This implies a causal relationship between acceptance and agreeableness, which might not always be the case. Acceptance of a fact does not necessarily mean that one feels agreeable; one might accept a fact reluctantly or with discomfort. Additionally, agreeableness is a personality trait that encompasses more than just reactions to facts\u2014it relates to one's general disposition towards cooperation and social harmony. Therefore, the statement is an oversimplification and does not universally hold true.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1714, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accepts the fact then max gains knowledge.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max accepts the fact then Max gains knowledge\" implies a direct relationship between accepting a fact and gaining knowledge. Accepting a fact suggests that Max acknowledges its truth or validity, which inherently adds to his understanding or awareness of that particular topic or situation. By accepting a fact, Max is incorporating new information into his existing knowledge base, which can be considered as gaining knowledge. Therefore, the statement aligns with a common-sense understanding of how knowledge acquisition typically works through the acceptance of true information. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1715, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accepts the fact then max intends to to be agreeable.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max accepts the fact then Max intends to be agreeable\" implies that accepting a fact leads directly to an intention to be agreeable. However, accepting a fact can happen for various reasons, such as understanding evidence or recognizing truth, which doesn't necessarily correlate with the intention of being agreeable. People might accept facts reluctantly or with no intention of being agreeable, but simply because they acknowledge the truth. Therefore, the statement assumes a direct relationship between acceptance and agreeableness that is not necessarily true in all cases. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 1716, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accepts the fact then max intends to to learn something new.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max accepts the fact then Max intends to learn something new\" implies that accepting a fact leads to an intention to learn something new. This seems to suggest that Max is open-minded and willing to adjust his understanding or knowledge based on new information. It's a logical assumption that if someone accepts a fact, especially if it's a new or challenging fact, it could spark curiosity or a desire to further explore and learn about the topic.\n\nHowever, the statement assumes a direct causation between acceptance of a fact and the intention to learn something new, which might not always hold true. People can accept facts without necessarily seeking to learn more about them, especially if the fact is straightforward or if they are not particularly interested in the topic.\n\nSo the statement does not universally apply as common sense, as it depends on the individual's attitude towards learning and curiosity.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1717, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accepts the fact then max intends to to move on.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests a causal relationship between accepting a fact and intending to move on. Common sense would dictate that accepting a fact often leads to some form of resolution or closure, which could involve moving on from the situation. However, it's important to note that this isn't always the case, as individuals may accept facts but still struggle to move on due to emotional, psychological, or circumstantial factors. Despite this, the general idea that acceptance can facilitate moving forward is a concept that aligns with common sense understanding of human behavior and coping mechanisms. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1718, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accepts the fact then max is brave.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max accepts the fact then Max is brave\" implies a cause-and-effect relationship between accepting a fact and being brave. Accepting a fact could be related to bravery if the fact is a difficult or uncomfortable truth that requires courage to acknowledge. However, without additional context, it is not universally true that accepting any fact demonstrates bravery. It depends on the nature of the fact and the circumstances surrounding it. Therefore, it cannot be considered common sense as it is too vague and situational.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1719, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accepts the fact then max is thoughtful.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max accepts the fact then Max is thoughtful\" implies a direct correlation between accepting a fact and being thoughtful. While being open to accepting facts can be a characteristic of a thoughtful person, it does not necessarily mean that anyone who accepts a fact is thoughtful. Thoughtfulness encompasses a broader range of qualities including consideration, empathy, and reflection, which are not explicitly covered by simply accepting a fact. Accepting a fact could be due to various reasons such as evidence or peer pressure, not necessarily thoughtfulness.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1720, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accepts the fact then max is understanding.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max accepts the fact then Max is understanding\" implies a cause-and-effect relationship where acceptance of a fact leads to being understanding. This suggests that by accepting reality or truth, Max demonstrates open-mindedness and comprehension. However, acceptance alone does not necessarily equate to understanding. One can accept a fact reluctantly or without fully grasping its implications. True understanding involves deeper cognitive processing and integration of information. Therefore, the statement oversimplifies the relationship between acceptance and understanding.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1721, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accepts the fact then max learns a new skill.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max accepts the fact then Max learns a new skill\" suggests a causal relationship between accepting a fact and acquiring a new skill. Common sense would indicate that simply accepting a fact does not necessarily lead to the acquisition of a new skill, as learning a new skill typically involves practice, training, or education beyond just accepting information. Therefore, the statement does not align with common sense, which dictates that more than acceptance of a fact is required to develop a new skill.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1722, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accepts the fact then max needs to know about it.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests a logical relationship between accepting a fact and having knowledge about it. If Max accepts something as a fact, it implies that he has a certain level of understanding or awareness about it, as one cannot accept something they are completely unaware of. Accepting a fact generally involves a conscious acknowledgment which is predicated on knowing that fact in the first place. Therefore, it is reasonable to say that if Max accepts the fact, it follows that he already knows about it, making this statement aligned with common sense. \n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1723, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accepts the fact then max wants to give him punishment.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max accepts the fact then Max wants to give him punishment\" does not necessarily follow common sense reasoning because accepting a fact does not inherently imply a desire to punish someone. Accepting a fact simply means acknowledging the truth or reality of a situation, while the desire to administer punishment involves a judgment or emotional response to that fact. These are two separate cognitive processes and one does not automatically lead to the other.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1724, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accepts the fact then max wants to go home and recover.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max accepts the fact then Max wants to go home and recover\" involves a cause-and-effect relationship that isn't necessarily supported by common sense alone. Accepting a fact doesn't inherently lead to the desire to go home and recover, as the nature of the fact and Max's personal circumstances or disposition would influence his response. Common sense would suggest that more context is needed to determine if accepting a fact would lead to wanting to go home and recover, as not all facts or situations would elicit the same response. Therefore, the statement does not align universally with common sense without additional information.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1725, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accepts the fact then max wants to not complain.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that accepting a fact leads to a desire not to complain about it. This implies that once Max acknowledges the reality of a situation, he is willing to not voice dissatisfaction or objections, perhaps because acceptance involves a degree of resignation or understanding. This idea aligns with a common psychological response where acceptance of circumstances often reduces the inclination to protest or feel negatively about them. Thus, it could be seen as a form of common sense that accepting a fact diminishes the desire to complain about it.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1726, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accepts the fact then max wants to quit the job.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max accepts the fact then Max wants to quit the job\" does not necessarily follow common sense reasoning because accepting a fact does not inherently imply a desire to quit a job. Accepting a fact could pertain to any number of situations, and the decision to quit a job could be influenced by various other factors that are not addressed in the statement. Without additional context linking the acceptance of the specific fact to the decision to quit, it is not reasonable to assume that one directly leads to the other. \n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1727, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accepts the invitation then max feels glad.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max accepts the invitation then Max feels glad\" implies a cause-and-effect relationship where accepting the invitation leads to Max feeling glad. This suggests that Max had a positive inclination towards the event or the person who invited him, making him feel happy about accepting it. In everyday situations, people generally accept invitations to events they are interested in or will enjoy, which would lead to feeling glad. Therefore, it can be considered common sense that accepting an invitation would result in positive feelings if the invitation is aligned with one's interests or desires.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1728, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accepts the invitation then max feels grateful.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max accepts the invitation then Max feels grateful\" implies a cause-and-effect relationship where accepting an invitation directly leads to feelings of gratitude. However, it's not necessarily common sense to assume this relationship universally. Gratitude is a personal and subjective emotion that can be influenced by various factors such as the nature of the invitation, the relationship between Max and the inviter, or Max's current emotional state. While it's possible that accepting an invitation could lead to feelings of gratitude, it's not a guaranteed or automatic response.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1729, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accepts the invitation then max has fun at party.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max accepts the invitation then Max has fun at the party\" suggests a cause-and-effect relationship between accepting the invitation and having fun at the party. However, whether or not Max has fun at the party depends on various factors such as the party atmosphere, the people attending, Max's mood, and personal preferences, among others. Accepting the invitation does not guarantee that Max will have fun, as it only ensures his attendance. Therefore, the statement oversimplifies the scenario by assuming a direct correlation between acceptance and enjoyment. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 1730, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accepts the invitation then max intends to to have fun.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests a causal relationship between accepting an invitation and intending to have fun. It implies that if Max chooses to accept an invitation, it is because he anticipates enjoying himself at the event. This is a reasonable assumption, as most people generally attend social gatherings with the expectation of having a good time. Therefore, the statement aligns with common sense, as it reflects typical human behavior and motivations in social situations.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1731, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accepts the invitation then max intends to to see some people.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max accepts the invitation then Max intends to see some people\" implies that accepting an invitation generally involves interacting with others who are also attending the event. With this understanding, it makes sense that accepting an invitation indicates an intention to see people. Typically, invitations are linked to social gatherings or events where multiple people are present. Therefore, accepting an invitation logically suggests that Max is prepared and willing to engage with other attendees.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1732, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accepts the invitation then max is open.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max accepts the invitation then Max is open\" seems to imply that accepting the invitation is an indication of Max being open, possibly in terms of his schedule or willingness to participate. However, the connection between accepting an invitation and being \"open\" could be ambiguous without further context. It is not necessarily common sense to assume that accepting an invitation directly equates to being open, as \"open\" could have multiple interpretations such as being emotionally open, open-minded, or having free time. The statement lacks clarity on what specific aspect of \"openness\" it refers to.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1733, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accepts the invitation then max makes a friend.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max accepts the invitation then Max makes a friend\" suggests a causality where accepting an invitation leads to forming a friendship. This can often be true as accepting an invitation usually involves social interaction, which is a common way to make friends. However, it is not guaranteed that every time someone accepts an invitation, they will make a friend. Friendships depend on mutual feelings, compatibility, and other factors beyond just being present at an event.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1734, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accepts the invitation then max needs to be important.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max accepts the invitation then Max needs to be important\" seems to suggest a condition where Max's acceptance of the invitation is contingent upon his importance. This may not necessarily be common sense, as the importance of an individual may not be a direct or sole factor in determining whether they accept an invitation. People may accept invitations for various reasons such as personal interest, social connections, obligation, or curiosity, which are not strictly tied to their importance or status. Therefore, the statement might not align with common sense as it implies a direct causation that might not universally hold true.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1735, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accepts the invitation then max needs to open the envelope.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max accepts the invitation then Max needs to open the envelope\" implies a logical sequence where accepting the invitation is contingent on knowing the details inside the envelope. Generally, an invitation provides necessary information such as the event details and how to respond, which are typically enclosed in an envelope. If Max has accepted the invitation, it suggests that he has already accessed this information, likely by opening the envelope. Therefore, the statement might be considered redundant rather than an example of common sense. It seems more logical to say, \"If Max needs to know the details of the invitation, then Max needs to open the envelope.\" So the answer is no."}
{"id": 1736, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accepts the invitation then max wants to prepare a speech.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max accepts the invitation then Max wants to prepare a speech\" suggests a causal relationship between accepting the invitation and wanting to prepare a speech. However, this relationship isn't necessarily common sense, as accepting an invitation doesn't automatically imply a desire or requirement to prepare a speech. The nature of the event and Max's role in it would dictate the necessity of a speech. Without additional context about the type of event or Max's responsibilities, it is not reasonable to assume that accepting an invitation universally leads to wanting to prepare a speech. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 1737, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accepts the invitation then sam feels happy.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max accepts the invitation then Sam feels happy\" implies a cause-and-effect relationship where Max's acceptance of the invitation directly influences Sam's emotions. The validity of this statement as common sense depends on the context of their relationship and the significance of the invitation. If Sam values Max's presence and the event is important to Sam, then it is reasonable for Sam to feel happy if Max accepts. However, without additional context about their relationship or the nature of the event, it's not universally common sense to assume that Max's acceptance would always result in Sam's happiness.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1738, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accepts the invitation then sam receives notice.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max accepts the invitation then Sam receives notice\" does not necessarily follow common sense without additional context or information about the relationship between Max accepting the invitation and Sam receiving notice. Common sense would require an understanding of how these two events are logically or causally connected. For instance, if Max's acceptance triggers a notification system that informs Sam, then it would make sense. However, without such information, it is not possible to determine that the statement aligns with common sense solely based on the information given. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 1739, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accepts the invitation then sam smiles.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If max accepts the invitation then sam smiles\" is not necessarily common sense because it relies on specific knowledge about the relationship between Max and Sam, and how Sam reacts to Max's actions. Common sense typically involves general knowledge or beliefs that are widely accepted and do not require specific context. Without knowing the specific dynamics between Max and Sam, one cannot assume that Sam smiling is a direct result of Max accepting an invitation. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 1740, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accepts the job then max buys a bigger house.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max accepts the job then Max buys a bigger house\" is contingent on several factors, including the salary and benefits of the new job, Max's personal and financial circumstances, and the housing market. Accepting a job doesn't necessarily mean that someone will buy a bigger house, as they may have other priorities or financial obligations. Additionally, the job might not provide enough financial increase to afford a bigger house, or Max might be content with his current living situation. Therefore, the statement is not necessarily common sense as it assumes a direct and guaranteed causation that might not exist. \n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1741, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accepts the job then max feels relieved.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max accepts the job then Max feels relieved\" implies a cause-and-effect relationship where accepting the job leads to a feeling of relief. This could be common sense if Max was previously anxious or stressed about job security or finding employment. Accepting a job might alleviate those concerns, leading to relief. However, the statement could also not hold true if the job isn't what Max truly wanted or if it comes with other stressors, meaning relief isn't a guaranteed outcome. Thus, while the statement could be plausible in certain contexts, it is not universally applicable as a common sense assumption without knowing more specific details about Max's situation and feelings toward the job. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 1742, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accepts the job then max intends to to be employed.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max accepts the job then Max intends to be employed\" is based on the logical assumption that accepting a job implies a desire or intention to be employed. Generally, accepting a job is a conscious decision made with the understanding that it will lead to employment, which fulfills certain needs or goals such as earning income, pursuing a career, or gaining experience. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that if Max accepts the job, he does so with the intention of being employed.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1743, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accepts the job then max intends to to support their family.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max accepts the job then Max intends to support their family\" implies a logical connection between accepting a job and intending to support one's family. In many cases, people accept jobs to earn income and provide financial stability for their families, so there is a common practical reason why this statement could be considered common sense. However, it's important to note that motives for accepting a job can vary widely from person to person, and not everyone has a family to support or may have different primary motivations such as career advancement or personal fulfillment. Therefore, while the statement could be true in many situations, it is not universally applicable to all individuals. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 1744, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accepts the job then max is brave.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max accepts the job then Max is brave\" implies a direct correlation between accepting a job and being brave. However, without further context about the nature of the job, it's not possible to determine if the job requires bravery. Accepting a job could be for various reasons such as financial necessity, career advancement, or personal interest, which don\u2019t necessarily relate to bravery. Therefore, the statement cannot be deemed as common sense without knowing the specifics of the job. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 1745, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accepts the job then max is competent.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max accepts the job then Max is competent\" implies a direct correlation between Max's acceptance of the job and his competence. In reality, accepting a job does not necessarily mean that a person is competent for that role. Competence involves having the necessary skills, knowledge, and ability to perform a job effectively, which cannot be solely determined by the act of accepting a job offer. Other factors such as qualifications, experience, and training are crucial in determining competence.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1746, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accepts the job then max is confident.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max accepts the job then Max is confident\" implies a cause-and-effect relationship where accepting the job is an indication of confidence. This could make sense in many contexts, as people often accept job offers when they feel confident in their ability to perform the required tasks and fulfill the responsibilities. However, it's not necessarily always true that someone accepts a job solely based on confidence; factors such as financial necessity or lack of other options might compel someone to accept a job even if they don't feel completely confident. Therefore, while the statement could be true in many cases, it doesn't universally hold as a common-sense rule.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1747, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accepts the job then max is hardworking.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max accepts the job then Max is hardworking\" is not necessarily common sense. Accepting a job does not inherently imply that someone is hardworking. A person might accept a job for various reasons such as financial necessity, interest in the field, or other personal motivations that are not directly related to their work ethic. Being hardworking is a characteristic that is demonstrated through consistent effort and dedication in performing job duties, which cannot be solely determined by the act of accepting a job.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1748, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accepts the job then max wants a stable situation.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max accepts the job then Max wants a stable situation\" implies a cause-and-effect relationship where accepting the job indicates a desire for stability. It is common for individuals to seek stability in their professional lives, as stable jobs often provide consistent income, predictable schedules, and a sense of security. Therefore, if Max accepts the job, it could be inferred that he values these aspects and is looking for a stable situation.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1749, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accepts the job then sam feels proud.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max accepts the job then Sam feels proud\" implies a cause-and-effect relationship between Max accepting a job and Sam feeling proud. This relationship could be common sense if Sam has a personal connection or investment in Max's success, such as if Sam is a mentor, family member, or close friend who has supported or guided Max. However, without further context about the relationship between Max and Sam and the significance of the job, it's not possible to definitively say that it's common sense. Feelings of pride can be subjective and depend on individual circumstances and relationships.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1750, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accepts the offer then max gets new job.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max accepts the offer then Max gets a new job\" implies a cause-and-effect relationship between accepting the offer and obtaining a new job. In typical scenarios, accepting a job offer indeed leads to the person getting the job, as the offer is a formal proposal of employment. Therefore, the statement aligns with logical reasoning and general expectations in employment contexts.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1751, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accepts the offer then max intends to to benefit from it.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max accepts the offer then Max intends to benefit from it\" implies that Max's acceptance of the offer is motivated by a desire to gain some advantage or positive outcome. This is a logical assumption as people generally make decisions based on the potential benefits they anticipate. Accepting an offer usually indicates that the individual sees value in it, whether that value is financial, emotional, practical, or otherwise. Therefore, it is common sense to assume that if Max accepts the offer, he does so with the intention of benefiting in some way. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1752, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accepts the offer then max intends to to get the new job.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max accepts the offer then Max intends to get the new job\" is based on the assumption that accepting a job offer is indicative of an intention to take on the new role associated with that offer. When someone accepts a job offer, it generally implies that they have made a decision to move forward with that employment opportunity, which reflects an intention to take up the new job. This intention can be inferred from the action of accepting the offer, as it would be illogical to accept a job offer without planning to fulfill the duties of that job.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1753, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accepts the offer then max intends to to make a deal.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max accepts the offer then Max intends to make a deal\" implies a logical connection between accepting an offer and intending to make a deal. When someone accepts an offer, it generally indicates that they agree to the terms and conditions laid out in the offer and are willing to follow through with the necessary actions to complete the agreement. Intending to make a deal is a natural consequence of accepting an offer, as acceptance usually suggests a commitment to engage in the transaction or agreement proposed. Therefore, it is reasonable to believe that if Max accepts the offer, he indeed has the intention to make a deal.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1754, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accepts the offer then max is content.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max accepts the offer then Max is content\" implies a cause-and-effect relationship where accepting the offer leads to Max being content. This suggests that the offer includes terms or conditions that Max finds favorable or satisfactory, leading him to feel content upon acceptance. However, it's possible that Max may accept the offer for reasons other than contentment, such as external pressures, lack of alternatives, or strategic reasons that don't necessarily make him content. Therefore, the statement assumes that acceptance equates to contentment without considering other potential factors influencing Max's decision. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 1755, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accepts the offer then max needs offer a quote.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests a causal relationship between Max accepting an offer and the need to provide a quote. In many business contexts, providing a quote is a prerequisite step before an offer is accepted, as it outlines the terms, costs, and details of a service or product. However, the statement implies that the quote is needed after the acceptance of the offer, which is not typical in standard business practices since the quote usually informs the decision to accept the offer.\n\nTherefore, the statement does not align with common business practices and logical sequence of events. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 1756, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accepts the offer then max needs provide a service.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max accepts the offer then Max needs to provide a service\" suggests a conditional relationship between accepting an offer and the obligation to provide a service. This is a logical consequence in many real-world scenarios, such as employment contracts or service agreements, where accepting an offer typically implies a commitment to fulfill certain duties or provide a service in exchange. It reflects a general understanding of reciprocal agreements and is aligned with common contractual principles.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1757, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accepts the offer then max needs to listen to the offer.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max accepts the offer then Max needs to listen to the offer\" is based on the logical premise that in order to make an informed decision about accepting an offer, one must first understand the details of the offer. Listening to the offer is necessary in order to comprehend what is being proposed, the terms, conditions, and implications of accepting it. Without listening and understanding the offer, Max wouldn't be able to make a reasoned decision about whether or not to accept it. Therefore, the statement aligns with common sense as it reflects the natural sequence of decision-making which involves gathering information before making a choice.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1758, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accepts the offer then max praised.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If max accepts the offer then max praised\" does not necessarily align with common sense because accepting an offer and praising are two distinct actions that are not inherently linked. Accepting an offer implies agreement or consent to the terms presented, while praising involves expressing approval or admiration. It is possible for someone to accept an offer without openly praising it, especially if they have reservations or are neutral about it. Therefore, the statement does not logically follow as a common-sense conclusion.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1759, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accepts the offer then max shakes hands.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max accepts the offer then Max shakes hands\" implies a cause-and-effect relationship where accepting an offer leads to shaking hands. In many cultures, shaking hands is a common gesture of agreement, greeting, or sealing a deal. Therefore, it follows that if Max accepts an offer, it is likely that he would shake hands as a symbol of confirmation or agreement. This behavior aligns with social norms and expectations in various professional and personal contexts.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1760, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accepts the offer then max wants to shake their hand.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max accepts the offer then Max wants to shake their hand\" suggests a connection between accepting an offer and wanting to perform a handshake, which is often seen as a gesture of agreement, congratulations, or sealing a deal. In many social and professional contexts, shaking hands is a common way to express goodwill and finalize agreements. Therefore, it makes sense that if Max accepts an offer, he might want to shake hands as a sign of mutual respect and confirmation. However, this might not always be the case as personal preferences or cultural differences could influence Max's desire to shake hands. Nonetheless, in a general context, the statement aligns with typical social norms.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1761, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accepts the offer then max wants to write them a check.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max accepts the offer then Max wants to write them a check\" suggests a causal relationship between accepting an offer and wanting to write a check. However, this relationship is not necessarily common sense. Accepting an offer does not inherently mean that someone wants to write a check; it depends on the nature of the offer and the agreed-upon method of payment. For example, if the offer is related to purchasing goods or services, Max might want to pay with a check, but he could also choose to pay with cash, credit card, or digital payment methods. Furthermore, the desire to write a check is contingent on personal preferences and available payment options. Without more context about the offer and Max's preferences, we cannot assume that accepting an offer equates to a desire to write a check.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1762, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accepts the offer then sam wants to shake their hand.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max accepts the offer then Sam wants to shake their hand\" suggests a positive response from Sam to Max's acceptance of an offer, implying a gesture of goodwill, agreement, or congratulations. Handshakes are commonly used as a social gesture in various contexts including professional or celebratory situations. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that Sam's desire to shake hands is a common and understandable reaction to Max accepting an offer.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1763, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accepts without question then max is naive.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max accepts without question then Max is naive\" implies that accepting something without questioning or critically evaluating it suggests a lack of experience or wisdom. This is based on the idea that a person who is not naive would use their knowledge and experience to scrutinize and assess information before accepting it as true. Being critical and questioning is often associated with being more experienced and wise. Therefore, the statement aligns with a common understanding of what it means to be naive.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1764, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accepts without question then max needs to be given something.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests a causal relationship between Max's acceptance and the need to give him something. This could imply that Max's acceptance is conditional or that it comes with expectations. However, without additional context about the situation or Max's motivations and expectations, it's difficult to determine if this is a common-sense assumption. In general, accepting something without question does not necessarily mean there is an inherent need to give something in return unless specified or agreed upon. Therefore, the statement may not align with common sense in all cases.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1765, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accepts without question then max wants to feel sure.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests a causal relationship between Max's acceptance without question and his desire for certainty. Common sense would dictate that if someone accepts something without question, it could be because they trust the source, are indifferent, or are not interested in questioning it. However, it doesn't necessarily mean they want to feel sure; they might simply not care enough to question it or might be confident enough in the source. Therefore, the statement assumes a specific motivation (wanting to feel sure) that might not universally apply to all cases of acceptance without questioning. \n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1766, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accepts without question then sam feels happy and settled.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests a causal relationship between Max's acceptance and Sam's emotional state. However, without additional context about the nature of their relationship or the specific circumstances in which Max is accepting something, it's difficult to determine whether this is a common-sense statement. In general, one person's acceptance might influence another's emotions, but the extent and nature of that influence can vary widely depending on individual personalities and the situation at hand. Therefore, it is not necessarily common sense to assume that Sam always feels happy and settled simply because Max accepts something without question.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1767, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accepts without question then sam wants to part ways.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max accepts without question then Sam wants to part ways\" is not necessarily a matter of common sense, as it involves a specific conditional relationship between Max's acceptance and Sam's desires, which could be influenced by numerous personal and contextual factors not addressed in the statement. Common sense typically involves more general knowledge or widely understood principles that can be applied to various situations. This statement seems more like a specific scenario that would require additional information about the relationship and circumstances of Max and Sam to fully understand. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 1768, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accidentally bumped then max falls.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max accidentally bumped then Max falls\" suggests a cause-and-effect relationship between bumping and falling. However, whether this statement is common sense depends on the context and circumstances of the bump. Accidentally bumping into something does not necessarily mean that a person will fall; it could depend on factors such as the force of the bump, the stability of the person, and the surrounding environment. Therefore, the statement is an oversimplification and cannot be universally considered common sense. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 1769, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accidentally bumped then max is distracted.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max accidentally bumped then Max is distracted\" assumes that accidentally bumping into something is always a result of being distracted. However, there could be other reasons for accidentally bumping into something, such as poor visibility, obstacles in the path, or physical coordination issues. It is not necessarily true that an accidental bump is always due to distraction. Therefore, the statement might not be universally true and cannot be considered common sense in every situation.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1770, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accidentally bumped then max wants break down.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max accidentally bumped then Max wants break down\" does not follow common sense because it implies a causal relationship between an accidental bump and a desire for a breakdown, which is not logically or necessarily connected. Accidentally bumping into something does not typically lead to a desire for a breakdown. The statement lacks a clear and reasonable connection between the cause (accidental bump) and the effect (wanting a breakdown). So the answer is no."}
{"id": 1771, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accidentally bumped then max wants to avoid the spot in the future.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max accidentally bumped then Max wants to avoid the spot in the future\" suggests that Max would associate the spot with a negative experience and would want to avoid repeating it. This behavior is consistent with the concept of negative reinforcement, where avoiding a negative consequence reinforces a particular behavior. In this case, avoiding the spot where Max bumped serves as a way to prevent further discomfort or accidents. This kind of behavior is commonly observed in humans and animals as a natural instinct to protect oneself from potential harm. \n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1772, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accidentally bumped then sam yelled at.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max accidentally bumped then Sam yelled at\" suggests a cause-and-effect relationship where Sam's reaction (yelling) is triggered by Max's action (bumping). However, whether this is common sense depends on the context and the personalities involved. Accidentally bumping into someone might not always provoke yelling; some might respond more calmly or understandingly. Additionally, the statement lacks detail about the nature of the bump and the relationship between Max and Sam, which could influence the reaction. Therefore, the statement doesn't universally hold as common sense due to the variability in human reactions and relationships.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1773, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accidentally burned then max cries.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If max accidentally burned then max cries\" suggests that Max cries as a response to accidentally getting burned. This is a reasonable reaction, as being burned can cause pain and distress, which can lead to crying. It is a natural and common human response to express pain and seek comfort through crying. Therefore, the statement aligns with common human behavior in response to physical pain.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1774, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accidentally burned then max feels scared.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests a causal relationship between accidentally burning oneself and feeling scared. It is common for people to feel scared or anxious when they experience or narrowly avoid physical harm, as fear is a natural emotional response to danger or threat. Accidentally burning oneself can be a painful and alarming experience, triggering fear as a protective mechanism. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that Max would feel scared after accidentally burning himself.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1775, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accidentally burned then max is accident prone.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max accidentally burned then Max is accident prone\" implies a direct correlation between a single accident and being accident prone, which is not necessarily valid. Being accident prone typically refers to someone who frequently has accidents, not just one isolated incident. Therefore, one accidental burn does not automatically mean that Max is accident prone; more evidence of repeated accidents would be needed to make that determination.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1776, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accidentally cut then max get stiches.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max accidentally cut then Max gets stitches\" implies that if Max sustains a cut, he may require medical attention in the form of stitches. This is a reasonable assumption, as cuts can often require stitches to properly heal and prevent infection. The statement reflects a common understanding of basic first aid and medical response to injuries.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1777, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accidentally cut then max gets stitches.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If max accidentally cut then max gets stitches\" suggests that if Max sustains a cut, particularly a severe one, he would require medical attention in the form of stitches to properly heal the wound. This is a logical course of action to prevent infection and promote proper healing. It is a common understanding that significant cuts might need stitches, which is a standard medical response. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1778, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accidentally cut then max is careless.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max accidentally cut then Max is careless\" assumes that any accident is a result of carelessness, which is not always the case. Accidents can happen for a variety of reasons, including unforeseen circumstances, external factors, or even while exercising caution. Carelessness implies a lack of attention or consideration, which may not necessarily be the case in every accidental situation. Therefore, it is not common sense to generalize that an accident automatically indicates carelessness.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1779, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accidentally cut then max is unlucky.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If max accidentally cut then max is unlucky\" can be considered as common sense because it implies a sense of misfortune or bad luck associated with an unintended negative event, such as accidentally cutting oneself. Generally, accidents that result in harm or injury are often perceived as unlucky instances, as most people would prefer to avoid such outcomes. This perception aligns with a common understanding of luck as it relates to unexpected and undesirable events.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1780, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accidentally cut then max is violent.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If max accidentally cut then max is violent\" does not align with common sense because it assumes intent based on an accidental action. Accidents, by definition, are unintentional and do not reflect someone's inherent nature or behavior. Labeling someone as violent requires evidence of intentional harm or aggression, which is not present in an accidental scenario. Therefore, it is illogical to conclude that someone is violent based solely on an accidental action. \n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1781, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accidentally cut then max wants to get ointment.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max accidentally cut then Max wants to get ointment\" makes sense as a general assumption because ointment can help soothe and heal a cut, reduce the risk of infection, and alleviate discomfort. When someone gets a cut, it is common to seek some form of first aid to address the wound, and ointment is a typical go-to remedy. Therefore, it is reasonable to think that Max would want ointment after an accidental cut to aid in the healing process and minimize pain or complications. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1782, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accidentally cut then max wants to wash the wound.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max accidentally cut then Max wants to wash the wound\" is based on a common sense approach to basic first aid and hygiene. When a person sustains a cut, washing the wound is a standard practice to prevent infection and promote healing. It is a natural response for someone to want to clean a wound to avoid further complications. Therefore, it aligns with general health practices and self-care awareness.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1783, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accidentally dropped it then max did something wrong.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max accidentally dropped it then Max did something wrong\" is not necessarily common sense. The key aspect to consider here is the intention behind the action. If Max dropped something accidentally, it implies that there was no intention to cause harm or damage. Accidents can happen without any negligence or carelessness involved. Therefore, labeling the action as 'wrong' might be too harsh, as 'wrong' often implies a moral or ethical failing, which is not applicable in genuine accidents. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 1784, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accidentally dropped it then max feels apologetic.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max accidentally dropped it then Max feels apologetic\" is based on the assumption that Max feels remorse or regret for his actions that were accidental. Common sense suggests that when someone accidentally causes an event that may have negative consequences or results, they would naturally feel apologetic or sorry for what happened. This is tied to basic human emotions and social norms about taking responsibility for one's actions, even if they were unintentional. However, the degree of apologetic feeling might vary based on individual personality or the severity of the consequence.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1785, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accidentally dropped it then max feels sad.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max accidentally dropped it then Max feels sad\" implies a cause-and-effect relationship where an accidental action leads to an emotional response. It is common for people to feel sad or upset when they accidentally drop something, especially if the item is valuable, important, or has sentimental value. Feeling sad in such a situation is a natural emotional response as it may involve loss, inconvenience, or disappointment. \n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1786, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accidentally dropped it then max is confused.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max accidentally dropped it then Max is confused\" implies a direct correlation between dropping something accidentally and being confused. While dropping an object could be a result of confusion or distraction, it is not always the case. People can accidentally drop things for various reasons, such as being clumsy, not having a firm grip, or external factors that are unrelated to confusion. Therefore, the statement makes an assumption that may not always hold true.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1787, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accidentally dropped it then max wants smiles.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max accidentally dropped it then Max wants smiles\" does not follow common sense because the consequence (wanting smiles) does not logically follow from the premise (accidentally dropping something). Typically, when someone accidentally drops something, the expected response might be frustration, embarrassment, or a desire to fix or retrieve the dropped item, rather than a desire for smiles. The connection between the two ideas isn't clear or based on typical cause-and-effect reasoning.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1788, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accidentally dropped it then max wants to cry.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max accidentally dropped it then Max wants to cry\" suggests that Max feels upset or regretful about dropping something, possibly because it was valuable, important, or had sentimental value. It's common for people to feel emotional distress after accidentally losing or damaging something significant to them. Therefore, the statement aligns with a typical emotional response in such situations.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1789, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accidentally dropped it then max wants to panic.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max accidentally dropped it then Max wants to panic\" does not necessarily align with common sense, as the desire to panic is not a typical or rational response to dropping something accidentally. Common sense would suggest that a more appropriate response might be to feel upset or to try to rectify the situation, rather than wanting to panic. Panic is generally an involuntary response characterized by fear or anxiety, not something one actively wants.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1790, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accidentally dropped it then max wants to pick it up.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max accidentally dropped it then Max wants to pick it up\" assumes that Max has a desire to retrieve something he dropped by accident. This could be considered common sense if we assume that Max values the item and wants to regain possession of it. However, it's not universally true as Max might not care about the item or might be unable to pick it up for various reasons such as physical limitations or immediate circumstances. Therefore, the statement can't be considered common sense in every situation as it depends on specific factors related to both Max and the item in question. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 1791, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accidentally dropped then max breaks the glass.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max accidentally dropped then Max breaks the glass\" implies a cause-and-effect relationship where dropping an object, specifically glass, would likely result in it breaking due to the fragile nature of glass. Common sense suggests that fragile objects like glass are prone to breaking when subjected to impact or force, such as being dropped. Therefore, the statement aligns with a general understanding of the properties of glass and the consequences of dropping it.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1792, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accidentally dropped then max feels bad.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max accidentally dropped then Max feels bad\" suggests that Max would feel bad if he accidentally dropped something. This assumes that Max is capable of feeling emotions such as guilt or regret, which is typical human behavior when making a mistake. Therefore, it is common sense to assume that Max would feel bad if he accidentally dropped something as it aligns with typical human emotional responses to accidental mishaps. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1793, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accidentally dropped then max feels clumsy.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests a causal relationship between dropping something accidentally and feeling clumsy. In everyday life, it is common for people to feel clumsy or awkward when they make a mistake such as dropping an item. Feeling clumsy is a natural emotional response to such incidents as it reflects a momentary lapse in coordination or attention. Therefore, it is reasonable to say that the statement aligns with common sense. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1794, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accidentally dropped then max feels sad.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If max accidentally dropped then max feels sad\" seems to imply a cause-and-effect relationship where an accidental dropping leads to Max feeling sad. This could make sense if Max is a person who values or is emotionally attached to the item that he dropped, leading to feelings of sadness due to the loss or damage of the item. However, the statement could also be seen as an assumption since not everyone may necessarily feel sad after dropping something, depending on the context and the value of the item to the individual. Therefore, while the statement could be reasonable in certain situations, it is not universally applicable as a common-sense rule. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 1795, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accidentally dropped then max is mistake prone.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If max accidentally dropped then max is mistake prone\" implies a generalization based on a single incident, which may not be a fair or accurate assessment of Max's overall tendency to make mistakes. An accidental drop could be an isolated incident and not necessarily indicative of being mistake-prone. Common sense suggests considering a pattern of behavior over time before labeling someone as mistake-prone. Therefore, it would not be reasonable to conclude that Max is mistake-prone based solely on one accidental drop. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 1796, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accidentally fell then max feels embarrassed.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max accidentally fell then Max feels embarrassed\" is based on the assumption that falling in front of others can lead to feelings of embarrassment due to perceived clumsiness or awkwardness. This is a typical emotional response many people might experience as falling can attract unwanted attention and may make the individual feel self-conscious. However, not everyone may feel embarrassed in such a situation depending on their personality, confidence, or the context in which the fall occurred. Nevertheless, it is a common enough reaction that the statement can be considered aligned with common sense for most cases. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1797, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accidentally fell then max feels hurt.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max accidentally fell then Max feels hurt\" is based on the general understanding that falling can cause physical pain or discomfort. When someone falls, it is common for them to experience some level of hurt, whether it be minor or severe, depending on the nature of the fall. Pain is a natural response of the body to injury or potential injury, and falling often involves sudden impact or jarring movements that can lead to such sensations. \n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1798, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accidentally fell then max is hurt.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max accidentally fell, then Max is hurt\" suggests a causal relationship between falling and being hurt. While it is common for someone to sustain some level of injury when they fall, the extent of the injury can vary significantly. It is possible for someone to fall and not be hurt at all, depending on factors like the height of the fall, the surface they fell on, and how they landed. Therefore, the statement assumes that any fall results in injury, which is not always the case. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 1799, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accidentally fell then max wants brush off dirt.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement is based on a common reaction that people have when they fall and get dirty: they usually want to brush off the dirt to clean themselves. It is a natural response to want to remove dirt and maintain cleanliness. Therefore, it makes sense that Max would want to brush off the dirt if he accidentally fell.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1800, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accidentally fell then max wants to get up.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max accidentally fell then Max wants to get up\" is generally considered common sense because it is a natural human response to want to correct a sudden and unintended change in position, such as falling. When people fall, they usually want to return to a stable and upright position for comfort, safety, and to continue their activities. It is a typical reaction to seek to regain balance and normalcy after an accident. Therefore, it aligns with common sense that Max would want to get up after accidentally falling.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1801, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accidentally fell then sam feels shocked.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max accidentally fell, then Sam feels shocked\" suggests a causal relationship between an accident and an emotional response. It is reasonable to assume that witnessing someone, especially someone known, having an accident could elicit feelings of shock or surprise. Shock is a common emotional response to unexpected and potentially distressing events like accidents. Therefore, it makes sense that Sam would feel shocked if he witnessed Max accidentally falling.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1802, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accidentally hit then max hand broken.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If max accidentally hit then max hand broken\" does not necessarily represent common sense, as it implies a direct causation between hitting something accidentally and a hand being broken, which is not always the case. Accidents can result in various outcomes and do not always lead to severe injuries like a broken hand. The outcome depends on factors such as the force of the hit, the object involved, and the vulnerability of the hand. Therefore, the statement oversimplifies the possible consequences of an accidental hit.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1803, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accidentally hit then max is hurt.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max accidentally hit then Max is hurt\" seems to imply a cause-and-effect relationship where an accidental hit results in Max being hurt. This could be common sense if we assume that the hit is of a nature that would typically cause pain or injury. However, the statement lacks context about the severity or nature of the hit, and not all accidental hits necessarily result in being hurt (e.g., a very light or minor contact might not cause any pain or injury). Therefore, without additional context, it's hard to definitively say that this statement aligns with common sense as it oversimplifies the scenario.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1804, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accidentally hit then max is sorry.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests a causal relationship between accidentally causing harm and feeling sorry for the action. It is common for individuals to feel remorse or regret when their actions, even if accidental, negatively affect others. Feeling sorry after causing harm, even unintentionally, reflects empathy and accountability, which are generally considered positive and common moral values. Therefore, the statement aligns with typical human emotional responses and social norms. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1805, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accidentally kicked then max cries.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max accidentally kicked then Max cries\" suggests that Max cries as a result of accidentally kicking something. This could imply that Max feels remorse or pain from the action, which could be a common emotional response. However, crying is not a universal reaction to accidentally kicking something, as individuals may react differently based on their pain tolerance, emotional state, and the context of the situation. Therefore, it is not necessarily common sense to assume that Max would cry every time he accidentally kicks something, as reactions can vary greatly.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1806, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accidentally kicked then max feels embarrassed.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests a causal relationship between accidentally kicking and feeling embarrassed. It is common for people to feel embarrassed when they make a mistake or have an accident, especially in a social setting. Feeling embarrassed is a natural emotional response to unintended actions that may have caused inconvenience or harm to others. Thus, it is reasonable to assume that if Max accidentally kicked someone or something, he might feel embarrassed about his actions.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1807, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accidentally kicked then max feels guilty.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests a causal relationship between an accidental action (kicking) and an emotional response (feeling guilty). Common sense indicates that people often feel guilty or remorseful after causing harm or inconvenience to others, even if the action was accidental. Feeling guilty in such a situation shows empathy and consideration for others' well-being. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that Max would feel guilty after accidentally kicking someone, as it aligns with typical human emotions and social expectations. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1808, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accidentally knocked over then max feels sorry.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max accidentally knocked over then Max feels sorry\" implies that Max would feel remorse if he caused something to fall over unintentionally. This suggests that Max has a sense of empathy and responsibility, which are common human traits. It is generally accepted that people feel sorry or guilty when they accidentally cause harm or inconvenience to others. Therefore, this statement aligns with typical human behavior and emotions. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1809, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accidentally knocked over then max is careless.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max accidentally knocked over then Max is careless\" implies a direct correlation between an accident and carelessness, which may not always be true. Accidents can occur for a variety of reasons, including external factors beyond one's control, and do not necessarily indicate a lack of care or attention. Carelessness implies a disregard for caution or responsibility, which may not be the case in every accidental situation. Therefore, labeling someone as careless based solely on an accidental action is an oversimplification and may not accurately reflect the circumstances.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1810, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accidentally knocked over then max spills drinks.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max accidentally knocked over then Max spills drinks\" implies a cause-and-effect relationship where knocking something over results in spilling drinks. This is a logical consequence because when objects, such as cups or glasses, are knocked over, the contents inside them, such as drinks, are likely to spill out. Therefore, this statement aligns with common sense understanding of physical actions and their consequences. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1811, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accidentally knocked then max feels embarassed.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max accidentally knocked then Max feels embarrassed\" suggests that Max feels embarrassed as a result of accidentally knocking, perhaps on a door or object. This statement could be considered common sense as it aligns with typical human emotions and reactions. When someone makes a mistake or has an accident, it is natural for them to feel embarrassed, especially if it draws attention or disrupts others. The statement reflects a common emotional response to such situations, making it relatable and sensible in everyday social contexts.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1812, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accidentally knocked then max feels stupid.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests a causal relationship between accidentally knocking and feeling stupid. While it is possible for someone to feel embarrassed or self-conscious after making an accidental mistake, it is not necessarily true that everyone would feel stupid in such a situation. People's reactions to their own mistakes can vary widely based on their personality, self-esteem, and the context of the situation. Therefore, the statement cannot be considered universally true as common sense. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 1813, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accidentally knocked then sam feels confused.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max accidentally knocked then Sam feels confused\" does not necessarily follow common sense without further context. Common sense suggests that there would need to be a logical connection between Max knocking accidentally and Sam feeling confused. If Max's knocking led to a misunderstanding or unexpected situation, then Sam might feel confused. However, without additional information about the relationship between the knocking and Sam's confusion, it's difficult to determine a direct cause-and-effect relationship based on common sense alone. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 1814, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accidentally knocked then sam feels livid.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max accidentally knocked then Sam feels livid\" implies a cause-and-effect relationship where Sam's intense anger (livid) is a direct result of Max's accidental action (knocking). Common sense suggests that accidental actions, while potentially annoying, do not typically provoke extreme reactions such as feeling livid unless there is an underlying reason or context that makes the action particularly upsetting. Without further context to explain why Sam would feel livid over an accidental knock, it is not reasonable to assume such a strong reaction as common sense. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 1815, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accidentally knocked then sam opens door.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max accidentally knocked then Sam opens door\" suggests a conditional relationship where Sam's action of opening the door is dependent on Max's action of knocking, even if it is accidental. In real-life scenarios, if someone knocks on a door, it is a common response for the person inside to open the door to see who is there or what they want. Therefore, the statement aligns with common social expectations and behaviors in response to someone knocking on a door.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1816, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accidentally left then max feels embarrassed.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max accidentally left, then Max feels embarrassed\" suggests a causal relationship between an accidental action and an emotional response. While it is possible for someone to feel embarrassed after accidentally leaving a place or situation, it is not a universal truth. Feelings of embarrassment depend on individual sensitivities, the context of the situation, and the perceived social implications of the action. Therefore, it is not common sense to assume that Max will necessarily feel embarrassed just because he left accidentally.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1817, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accidentally left then max feels surprised.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests a causal relationship between accidentally leaving and feeling surprised. It is common sense that if someone leaves a place unintentionally or without realizing it, they would likely feel surprised upon discovering their mistake. This is because the act of leaving accidentally implies a lack of awareness or intention, which naturally leads to surprise when the realization occurs.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1818, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accidentally left then max is dumb.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If max accidentally left then max is dumb\" is not necessarily common sense because it makes an assumption about someone's intelligence based on a single mistake or accident. It is not fair or logical to label someone as \"dumb\" simply because they made an accidental error. Everyone can make mistakes, and it does not necessarily reflect their overall intelligence or capabilities. Therefore, the statement lacks a reasonable basis and is not grounded in common sense. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 1819, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accidentally left then max needs he looked at his watch.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max accidentally left then Max needs he looked at his watch\" does not seem to follow common sense because it lacks logical coherence and grammatical structure. The use of \"needs\" in this context is confusing and does not clearly convey a cause-and-effect relationship or a condition. Typically, if someone accidentally leaves, the response might involve checking the time to gauge their schedule or punctuality, but the phrase \"needs he looked at his watch\" is not a commonly understood or sensible way to express this action. Therefore, the statement does not align with common sense reasoning.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1820, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accidentally poured then max feels nervous.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests a causal relationship between accidentally pouring something and feeling nervous. It is common for people to feel nervous or anxious when they make mistakes, such as spilling or pouring something unintentionally, due to possible consequences or embarrassment. This emotional response can be seen as a natural human reaction to unexpected and potentially disruptive events. Therefore, the statement aligns with a typical human emotional response to accidental actions. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1821, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accidentally poured then max gets wet.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max accidentally poured then Max gets wet\" seems to imply a cause-and-effect relationship where an accidental pouring of a liquid leads to Max getting wet. In everyday scenarios, if a liquid is accidentally poured on someone or if someone pours a liquid and it spills, it is common sense that the person involved would get wet. This is based on the basic understanding of the physical properties of liquids and how they interact with surfaces, including human skin or clothing.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1822, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accidentally poured then max needs to be drunk.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If max accidentally poured then max needs to be drunk\" does not necessarily align with common sense, as it implies that if someone accidentally pours a drink, they are obligated to consume it, regardless of the circumstances. In reality, there could be many reasons why someone should not drink what was accidentally poured, such as if the substance is harmful, if the individual does not wish to consume alcohol, or if they are not of legal drinking age. Additionally, accidents can happen without implying necessity or obligation to consume.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1823, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accidentally poured then max wants to clean the mess.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max accidentally poured then Max wants to clean the mess\" is based on the idea that individuals generally feel a sense of responsibility for their actions and their consequences, especially if they were accidental. It is common for people to want to rectify mistakes they have made, including cleaning up any messes they have caused. This reflects a common understanding of personal accountability and responsibility. Therefore, it is reasonable to consider this statement as aligned with common sense.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1824, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accidentally put then max feels badly.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests a causal relationship between two events: Max making a mistake and Max feeling bad about it. Common sense dictates that when someone makes a mistake, especially accidentally, they are likely to experience negative emotions such as regret, guilt, or disappointment. This emotional response is a natural human reaction to recognizing one's own errors and the potential consequences they might have.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1825, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accidentally ran then max is tackled by police.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max accidentally ran then Max is tackled by police\" does not necessarily align with common sense, as it implies a direct and inevitable consequence (being tackled by police) from an accidental action (running). In real-world scenarios, accidental running would not automatically lead to being tackled by police, as there could be many reasons someone might run accidentally without it being suspicious or leading to police intervention. Context, intent, and the environment would play significant roles in determining the outcome, and not all accidental running would result in such a drastic response.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1826, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accidentally shot then max wants to call the ambulance.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that if Max accidentally shot someone, he would want to call an ambulance, presumably to help the injured person and mitigate the consequences of the accident. This aligns with common sense, as it is a reasonable and responsible reaction to such an incident, demonstrating concern for the well-being of the injured party and a desire to rectify the situation as much as possible. Therefore, it can be considered a common sense response to want to provide immediate medical assistance in an accidental shooting situation.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1827, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accidentally shot then max wants to go to the hospital.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that if Max accidentally shot himself or got shot, then he would want to go to the hospital for medical care. This is a logical and reasonable assumption because a shooting injury can be serious and life-threatening, and seeking medical attention would be a priority for the majority of people in such a situation. The desire to go to the hospital after being shot is a common response to ensure one's health and safety.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1828, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accidentally shot then sam feels frightened.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests a causal relationship between two events: Max's accidental shooting and Sam feeling frightened. It's common sense to anticipate that someone would feel frightened in response to a potentially dangerous and unexpected situation, such as an accidental shooting. The presence of a firearm being discharged, even accidentally, can create a sense of fear or distress due to the potential risk of injury or harm. Therefore, it is reasonable to expect that Sam would feel frightened in this scenario.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1829, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accidentally shot then sam wants to go to a doctor.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max accidentally shot then Sam wants to go to a doctor\" does not seem to follow common sense because there is no clear logical connection between Max accidentally shooting and Sam wanting to go to a doctor. The statement assumes a cause-and-effect relationship that is not explained or justified. Typically, if Sam was injured as a result of Max's accidental shooting, it would make sense for Sam to want to see a doctor, but the statement does not specify that Sam was injured or affected by the shooting. Without more context or information linking the two events, the statement lacks a rational basis. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 1830, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accidentally spilled then max is irresponsible.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max accidentally spilled then Max is irresponsible\" assumes that an accident directly correlates with irresponsibility, which is not necessarily true. Accidents can happen to anyone, regardless of their level of responsibility. Being irresponsible implies a lack of care or attention, but an accident can occur even when someone is being careful. Therefore, the statement oversimplifies the relationship between accidents and irresponsibility. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 1831, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accidentally spilled then max needs to clean up mess.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max accidentally spilled then Max needs to clean up mess\" is based on the idea of taking responsibility for one's actions, even if they were unintentional. Cleaning up after oneself is a basic principle of accountability and respect for the environment and others who share the space. It is a common expectation in many societies that individuals address and rectify their own mistakes to maintain order and cleanliness. Therefore, the idea that someone should clean up their own mess is generally considered to be common sense.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1832, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accidentally spilled then max they clean up the mess.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that if Max accidentally spills something, then Max should clean up the mess. This is generally considered common sense because it promotes taking responsibility for one's actions and maintaining a clean and orderly environment. It is a basic principle of accountability and respect for shared spaces. Additionally, cleaning up after oneself can prevent accidents and further inconveniences for others. Therefore, it aligns with common social norms and expectations.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1833, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accidentally spilled then max they get another drink.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that if Max accidentally spills his drink, he should be allowed to get another one. This could be seen as a common sense approach in a social or hospitality setting, where it is courteous and considerate to replace a drink that was accidentally spilled. By providing a replacement, it ensures that Max still has a drink to enjoy and helps maintain a positive atmosphere. Therefore, it aligns with general expectations of politeness and customer service.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1834, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accidentally spilled then max wants to get a new drink.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max accidentally spilled then Max wants to get a new drink\" makes an assumption about Max's desire based on the incident of spilling. It is reasonable to think that if someone spills their drink, they might want to replace it, especially if they still want a drink. However, it's not necessarily true that everyone in such a situation would want a new drink, as it depends on individual preferences, circumstances, or availability of resources. Nonetheless, the assumption aligns with common sense because it follows a logical thought process that someone would want to replace something they've lost or spilled. \n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1835, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accidentally stepped then max feels sad.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max accidentally stepped then Max feels sad\" is not necessarily common sense because it lacks context and clarity on what Max stepped on and the consequences of his action. If Max stepped on something that caused harm or inconvenience to himself or others, such as stepping on a sharp object or someone else's property, then feeling sad could be a reasonable emotional response. However, if Max simply stepped on a harmless object or in a neutral situation, there might not be a reason for him to feel sad. The statement is too vague to determine the appropriateness of Max's emotions without additional information.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1836, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accidentally stepped then max wants wipe off foot.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement is common sense because it reflects a natural response to accidentally stepping on something undesirable: the desire to clean it off. This is a typical reaction as it helps maintain cleanliness and hygiene. Additionally, wiping off the foot can prevent any further spread of the substance that was stepped in. Therefore, the statement aligns with typical human behavior and reasoning in such situations.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1837, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accidentally tripped then max is not attentive.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If max accidentally tripped then max is not attentive\" assumes that tripping is always due to a lack of attentiveness. However, tripping can occur for various reasons, such as an unexpected obstacle, poor lighting, or even a medical condition affecting balance. It is not necessarily indicative of a person's attentiveness. Therefore, it is not common sense to assume that tripping automatically means someone is not attentive.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1838, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accidentally tripped then max needs to be clumsy.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max accidentally tripped then Max needs to be clumsy\" is not necessarily a reflection of common sense. Tripping accidentally can happen to anyone, regardless of their general level of clumsiness. It could be due to external factors such as an obstacle in the way, poor lighting, or slippery surfaces. Being clumsy means that someone frequently lacks coordination or grace in their movements, but a single incident of tripping does not automatically indicate that someone is inherently clumsy. Therefore, the statement makes an assumption that is not supported by a single incident alone.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1839, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accidentally tripped then max wants to cry.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max accidentally tripped then Max wants to cry\" suggests that Max's emotional response to tripping is to cry. This may not necessarily be true for everyone, as people can have different reactions to accidents. Some might feel embarrassed, others might laugh it off, and others might feel frustrated but not necessarily cry. Additionally, the desire to cry might depend on the severity of the fall and whether Max got hurt. Therefore, it's not universally applicable or common sense to assume that tripping would automatically make Max want to cry. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 1840, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accidentally tripped then max wants to fall to the ground.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max accidentally tripped then Max wants to fall to the ground\" does not align with common sense. Typically, when a person trips accidentally, it is an unintended and involuntary action, not a reflection of their desires or intentions. Generally, people do not want to fall to the ground as it could result in injury or discomfort. Therefore, the statement appears to confuse the involuntary result of tripping with a deliberate desire to fall. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 1841, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accidently left then max feels confused.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max accidentally left then Max feels confused\" suggests a causal relationship between leaving accidentally and feeling confused. It is common for someone to feel confused if they left a place or situation accidentally, as they might not have intended to leave and could be unsure of what to do next. This confusion could stem from disorientation or uncertainty about the circumstances that led to their accidental departure. Therefore, it makes sense that accidentally leaving could lead to feelings of confusion.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1842, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accidently left then max is aloof.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If max accidentally left then max is aloof\" does not necessarily follow common sense. The premise that Max left accidentally does not logically lead to the conclusion that Max is aloof. Leaving accidentally could happen for a variety of reasons such as being distracted, in a hurry, or simply making a mistake. Being aloof, on the other hand, refers to being distant or uninterested in social interactions, which is unrelated to the nature of leaving a place accidentally. Therefore, the statement lacks a logical connection between the premise and the conclusion. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 1843, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accidently left then max is silly.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If max accidentally left then max is silly\" suggests that making an accidental mistake equates to being silly. However, accidents can happen to anyone regardless of their level of silliness or carefulness. It's not reasonable to label someone as silly based solely on an accidental action, as it does not necessarily reflect their overall character or behavior. Therefore, the statement lacks a logical connection between an accidental departure and the inherent silliness of a person. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 1844, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accidently left then max needs to know where they are.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max accidentally left then Max needs to know where they are\" implies that if Max left a location without intending to or without being aware, then it's important for Max to know their current whereabouts to orient themselves and decide on further actions. It's common sense to ascertain one's location after unintentionally leaving somewhere to ensure safety and make informed decisions. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1845, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accidently left then max wants come back to place he left.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max accidentally left then Max wants to come back to the place he left\" assumes that Max has a desire to return to the location he left unintentionally. This assumption might not always hold true, as Max's desire to return could depend on various factors such as the reason for leaving, the significance of the place, or his current circumstances. Therefore, it isn't necessarily common sense to assume that an accidental departure automatically leads to a desire to return. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 1846, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accompanies by max's wife then max feels happy.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If max accompanies by max's wife then max feels happy\" is based on the assumption that Max enjoys being with his wife and that her presence brings him happiness. This could be true for many couples who have a strong and loving relationship. However, it is not universally applicable to all individuals or all marriages. Some people might not feel happy in their spouse's company due to various reasons such as relationship issues, personal differences, or other circumstances. Therefore, the statement cannot be considered common sense as it does not account for the complexities and variations in human relationships. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 1847, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accompanies by max's wife then max intends to to be with wife.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max accompanies by Max's wife then Max intends to be with wife\" suggests that if Max is accompanied by his wife, his intention is to be with her. This could be considered common sense because it is reasonable to assume that if someone chooses to bring their spouse along to an event or outing, they intend to spend time with them. Additionally, being accompanied by one's spouse usually implies a desire for companionship or togetherness. Therefore, the statement aligns with typical social expectations and norms regarding married couples.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1848, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accompanies by max's wife then max intends to to go somewhere.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max accompanies by Max's wife then Max intends to go somewhere\" implies a causal relationship between Max being accompanied by his wife and his intention to go somewhere. This statement makes sense if we consider that people generally do not accompany others without a purpose or intention to go to a specific destination. It is common for individuals to plan outings or trips together, especially if they are married. Thus, if Max is with his wife, it is reasonable to infer that they have a mutual intention to go somewhere.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1849, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accompanies by max's wife then max needs to get their wife.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max accompanies by Max's wife then Max needs to get their wife\" is somewhat confusing and appears to be logically inconsistent. If Max is already accompanied by Max's wife, then Max already has his wife with him, and there is no need to \"get\" her. The statement suggests an action that is redundant and unnecessary based on the premise given. Therefore, it does not align with common sense, as it defies the logical progression of events.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1850, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accompanies by sam's wife then max feels happy.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max accompanies Sam's wife then Max feels happy\" implies a direct correlation between Max's happiness and being in the company of Sam's wife. However, without knowing the nature of the relationship between Max and Sam's wife and what brings Max joy, it's difficult to definitively say that this statement is common sense. Happiness can be influenced by various factors beyond just company, and assuming that Max's happiness solely depends on accompanying Sam's wife may be an oversimplification. It is not a universally applicable or self-evident truth that would be considered common sense without additional context. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 1851, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accompanies sam far then max intends to to be a good friend.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max accompanies Sam far, then Max intends to be a good friend\" suggests that Max's actions of accompanying Sam a long distance are indicative of a positive intention, specifically to be a good friend. This statement relies on the assumption that traveling far with someone is a sign of support, care, and dedication, which are qualities of a good friend. In general, actions that involve effort and sacrifice, like traveling a long distance, are often seen as demonstrations of goodwill and commitment in friendships. Thus, the statement aligns with common sense understandings of how actions can reflect intentions in relationships.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1852, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accompanies sam far then max intends to to comfort him.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that if Max goes far with Sam, then Max's intention is to comfort him. This indicates a relationship of support and care between Max and Sam. In many contexts, accompanying someone over a long distance can be seen as a gesture of solidarity and support, especially if the journey is challenging or emotionally taxing. Therefore, it can be inferred that Max's intention to comfort Sam aligns with common sense understandings of companionship and support in relationships.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1853, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accompanies sam far then max intends to to keep sam company.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max accompanies Sam far, then Max intends to keep Sam company\" suggests that Max's act of accompanying Sam for a significant distance implies an intention to provide companionship. Common sense would dictate that if someone chooses to travel a long way with another person, it is likely because they want to be with them and provide company during the journey. This intention can be inferred from the effort and commitment of traveling a considerable distance together.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1854, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accompanies sam far then max wants to tell sam not to travel alone.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If max accompanies sam far then max wants to tell sam not to travel alone\" implies that Max is concerned for Sam's safety or well-being when traveling long distances. It suggests that Max believes traveling alone may not be safe or advisable for Sam, and therefore accompanies him to ensure his safety. This kind of protective behavior and advice is commonly seen among friends or companions who care for each other's safety, making the statement relatable and understandable in a real-world context.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1855, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accompanies sam far then sam feels grateful.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max accompanies Sam far then Sam feels grateful\" implies a cause-and-effect relationship where Sam's feeling of gratitude is directly linked to Max's action of accompanying him over a long distance. This assumption is based on the idea that companionship and support, especially over a long journey or distance, are generally appreciated and valued. This appreciation often manifests as gratitude. It is common for people to feel thankful when someone goes out of their way to help or support them.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1856, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accompanies sam far then sam feels wanted.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max accompanies Sam far then Sam feels wanted\" implies a direct correlation between Max's companionship and Sam's emotional state of feeling wanted. This statement could be considered common sense if Max and Sam have a close relationship and Sam values Max's company, as companionship can contribute to feeling valued and important. However, it is not universally applicable as individual emotional responses can vary greatly, and feeling wanted may not solely depend on another person's actions.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1857, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accompanies sam far then sam gets exercice.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that when \"max\" accompanies \"sam\" on a far distance, it results in \"sam\" getting exercise. This implies that \"sam\" and \"max\" are engaging in physical activity, such as walking or running, over a considerable distance, which naturally leads to exercise. Since physical activity is a well-known way to achieve exercise, the statement aligns with common sense. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1858, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accompanies sam far then sam has company.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max accompanies Sam far then Sam has company\" implies that Max being with Sam provides Sam with companionship. The statement is based on the understanding that accompanying someone means being with them, which naturally provides company. This is a logical and straightforward deduction based on the definition of the terms \"accompany\" and \"company.\" Therefore, the statement aligns with common sense as it follows a clear and reasonable line of thought.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1859, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accomplishes max's ends then max feels happy.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max accomplishes Max's ends then Max feels happy\" is based on the idea that achieving personal goals or objectives leads to a sense of fulfillment and happiness. This is a common psychological principle, as people generally feel a sense of satisfaction and contentment when they successfully meet their aims or aspirations. The sense of accomplishment can boost self-esteem and overall well-being. Therefore, it aligns with common sense that if Max achieves what he sets out to do, he would likely feel happy as a result.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1860, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accomplishes max's ends then max intends to to be satisfied.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max accomplishes Max's ends then Max intends to be satisfied\" implies a causal relationship between achieving goals and having the intention to be satisfied. Common sense suggests that when individuals set out to accomplish specific goals or ends, they generally do so with the intention of achieving a certain level of satisfaction or fulfillment. It is reasonable to assume that if Max accomplishes what Max aimed for, Max had the intention, at least subconsciously, of deriving satisfaction from that accomplishment. Therefore, the intention to be satisfied can be seen as a natural and typical underlying motive when pursuing and achieving personal goals.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1861, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accomplishes max's ends then max needs have a goal.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max accomplishes Max's ends then Max needs to have a goal\" implies a cause-and-effect relationship between having a goal and accomplishing ends. The term \"ends\" here refers to objectives or outcomes that Max aims to achieve. For Max to accomplish these ends, it logically follows that he must have had a specific goal or target in mind to begin with. Accomplishing something typically requires intention and purpose, both of which are encapsulated in having a goal. Therefore, the statement aligns with common sense as it suggests that achieving outcomes is predicated on having predefined objectives.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1862, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accomplishes max's goal then max feels happy.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max accomplishes Max's goal then Max feels happy\" is based on the idea that achieving personal goals generally leads to a sense of satisfaction and happiness. This is a common psychological response as accomplishing goals can boost self-esteem, provide a sense of achievement, and release positive neurotransmitters like dopamine. Therefore, it's reasonable to assume that when Max achieves what he aims for, it would result in a positive emotional state, such as happiness.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1863, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accomplishes max's goal then max feels proud.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max accomplishes Max's goal then Max feels proud\" is based on a common psychological response where achieving a personal goal leads to a sense of pride and accomplishment. Feeling proud is a natural emotional response to achieving something one has set out to do, as it reinforces self-efficacy and personal value. This connection between goal achievement and pride is widely observed and understood in human behavior. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1864, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accomplishes max's goal then max feels successful.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max accomplishes Max's goal then Max feels successful\" is based on the idea that achieving one's objectives often leads to a sense of accomplishment and satisfaction. Generally, when individuals set goals for themselves, the fulfillment of these goals is commonly associated with feelings of success and achievement. This is because goals are often set as benchmarks for personal or professional success, and meeting or exceeding these benchmarks typically validates the effort put into the endeavor, leading to a feeling of success.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1865, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accomplishes max's goal then max intends to to achieve a personal goal.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max accomplishes Max's goal then Max intends to achieve a personal goal\" suggests a logical relationship between accomplishing a goal and having the intention to achieve it. Common sense indicates that in order to accomplish a goal, one must first have the intention or desire to achieve it. Without intention, actions would lack direction and purpose. Therefore, if Max accomplishes his goal, it can be inferred that he had the intention to do so, as goals are typically set with personal objectives in mind.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1866, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accomplishes max's goal then max is encouraged to try more.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max accomplishes Max's goal then Max is encouraged to try more\" suggests that achieving a goal can boost motivation and confidence, prompting an individual to set and pursue further goals. This idea aligns with psychological principles such as positive reinforcement, where a positive outcome reinforces the behavior that led to it. When someone experiences success, it can increase their self-efficacy and drive to continue striving for more achievements. This is a commonly observed phenomenon in various aspects of life, including education, career, and personal development. Therefore, the statement reflects a common understanding of human behavior in response to success. \n\nSo the answer is yes."}

Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max accomplishes Max's goal then Max needs to work\" implies a cause-and-effect relationship where effort is required to achieve a desired outcome. This is a generally accepted principle, as goals typically require some form of effort or action to be accomplished. It suggests that success is not likely to be achieved without putting in the necessary work. Therefore, the statement aligns with common sense understanding that effort is a prerequisite for achieving goals.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1869, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accomplishes max's goal then max wants to perservere.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max accomplishes Max's goal then Max wants to persevere\" suggests a causal relationship between success and the desire to continue striving. Common sense might indicate that achieving a goal could lead to satisfaction and potentially lessen the immediate desire to persevere, as the specific objective has been met. However, it's also reasonable to think that accomplishing a goal could motivate Max to set new goals and continue persevering, driven by the confidence and momentum from the initial success. The interpretation depends on the context and Max's individual personality and circumstances. Without additional information about Max's specific situation and mindset, it's difficult to definitively say whether this statement aligns with common sense universally.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1870, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accomplishes max's goals then max intends to to be successful.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max accomplishes Max's goals then Max intends to be successful\" implies a causal relationship between accomplishing goals and intending to be successful. Generally, when someone sets and achieves goals, it can be inferred that they have a motivation or intention to succeed in those goals. The act of setting and striving towards goals typically indicates a desire for success. Therefore, if Max is accomplishing his goals, it is logical to deduce that he intends to be successful.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1871, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accomplishes max's goals then max wants to congratulate themselves.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max accomplishes Max's goals then Max wants to congratulate themselves\" suggests that achieving personal goals would naturally lead to a desire for self-recognition or self-celebration. It is common for individuals to feel a sense of pride or satisfaction upon reaching their objectives, and self-congratulation can serve as a positive reinforcement, encouraging further goal-oriented behavior. Therefore, it is reasonable to consider that someone might want to congratulate themselves after accomplishing their goals.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1872, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accomplishes max's goals then max wants to share with others.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max accomplishes Max's goals then Max wants to share with others\" suggests a causal relationship between achieving personal goals and the desire to share with others. However, the desire to share with others may not necessarily be linked to personal achievement. It largely depends on individual values, personality, and motivations, which can vary widely from person to person. Therefore, it isn't necessarily common sense to assume that achieving goals universally leads to a desire to share, as this may not hold true for everyone.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1873, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accomplishes max's goals then sam wants to celebrate with max.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max accomplishes Max's goals then Sam wants to celebrate with Max\" suggests a positive relationship between Max and Sam, wherein Sam supports and takes joy in Max's achievements. It is common for friends or colleagues to want to celebrate each other's successes as it strengthens relationships and fosters a supportive environment. Without additional context indicating otherwise, it is reasonable to assume that Sam's desire to celebrate with Max is a reflection of a positive and encouraging relationship. Therefore, the statement aligns with common social behaviors and norms. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1874, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accomplishes max's mission then max intends to to show off skills.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If max accomplishes max's mission then max intends to show off skills\" assumes a direct correlation between accomplishment and intention to show off skills, which may not necessarily be true. Accomplishing a mission could be driven by various motivations such as achieving a goal, solving a problem, or fulfilling a duty, and does not inherently imply an intention to show off skills. The intention to show off skills is a specific mindset that may or may not be present in every accomplishment scenario. Therefore, the statement is not necessarily common sense as it generalizes the intention behind accomplishing a mission without considering other possible motivations.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1875, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accomplishes max's mission then max needs to be determined.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max accomplishes Max's mission then Max needs to be determined\" suggests that in order to achieve a specific goal or mission, one must possess determination. Determination is often necessary to overcome obstacles and challenges, and to stay focused and motivated toward the end goal. Therefore, it is logical and reasonable to say that determination is a prerequisite for successfully accomplishing a mission.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1876, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accomplishes max's mission then max wants to rest.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that after completing a mission or task, Max desires rest. This is a reasonable assumption, as accomplishing a mission often requires effort and energy, leading to a natural desire for rest and recovery. It aligns with common human experiences where, after exertion or achieving a goal, individuals often feel the need to relax and recharge. Therefore, the statement can be considered as common sense as it reflects a typical response to expended effort.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1877, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accomplishes max's mission then sam feels grateful.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max accomplishes Max's mission then Sam feels grateful\" is contingent on the nature of Max's mission and its impact on Sam. If Max's mission directly benefits Sam or aligns positively with Sam\u2019s interests, it would be common sense for Sam to feel grateful. However, if Max's mission is unrelated to Sam or negatively affects Sam, it wouldn\u2019t make sense for Sam to feel grateful. Without knowing the specific details of Max's mission and its relation to Sam, it is not possible to definitively say if the statement is common sense. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 1878, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accomplishes max's mission then sam receives new information.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max accomplishes Max's mission then Sam receives new information\" may not necessarily be common sense, as it depends on the context and the relationship between Max's mission and Sam's access to information. If Max's mission directly involves gathering or producing new information that Sam is privy to, then it would make sense that Sam receives new information as a result. However, if Max's mission is unrelated to information that would be relevant or accessible to Sam, then there would be no direct reason for Sam to receive new information. Without specific context linking Max's mission to the information Sam receives, it's difficult to determine the statement as common sense.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1879, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accomplishes max's mission then sam wants to congratulate max.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max accomplishes Max's mission then Sam wants to congratulate Max\" suggests a natural and positive response of congratulating someone for achieving their goals or completing a task. It is common for people to feel happy for and acknowledge others' successes. Congratulating someone serves as a form of encouragement and recognition of their efforts and achievements. Therefore, it aligns with general social norms and behaviors observed in human interactions, where accomplishments are often met with congratulations from others.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1880, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accomplishes max's object then sam rewards x.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max accomplishes Max's object then Sam rewards X\" is contingent upon the specific context and relationships between Max, Sam, and X. It implies a cause-and-effect relationship where Sam's reward is dependent on Max's accomplishment. This could make sense in a scenario where Sam has set a goal for Max and promised a reward for achieving it. However, without additional context about the nature of their relationship, the conditions of the reward, and what \"X\" represents, it is difficult to determine if this statement aligns with common sense universally.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1881, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accomplishes max's objectives then max intends to to finish their work.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If max accomplishes max's objectives then max intends to finish their work\" suggests a logical progression where accomplishment of objectives is linked to the intention to complete tasks. Commonly, if someone is working towards and achieving their objectives, it can be inferred that they have the intention to see their work through to completion. Achieving objectives typically implies effort and commitment directed towards an end goal, which aligns with the intention to finish the work started. Thus, this statement aligns with a common-sense understanding of motivation and goal-directed behavior.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1882, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accomplishes max's purpose then max needs to get dressed and go out.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max accomplishes Max's purpose then Max needs to get dressed and go out\" is not necessarily common sense as it depends on the context of Max's purpose. If Max's purpose involves an activity that requires him to be outside or interact with others in person, such as attending a meeting or running an errand, then getting dressed and going out would make sense. However, if Max's purpose is something that can be accomplished from home, such as working remotely or completing an online task, then there is no need for him to get dressed and go out. The statement lacks information about the nature of Max's purpose, making it difficult to determine if it is common sense without additional context. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 1883, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accomplishes max's purpose then max pumps fist.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max accomplishes Max's purpose then Max pumps fist\" is contingent upon the specific context and the individual's habits or reactions. Fist pumping is a common gesture of celebration or triumph, so if Max is someone who typically expresses accomplishment or success through physical gestures like fist pumping, the statement would make sense. However, not everyone reacts in the same way, and some might express their achievement differently, such as through verbal exclamations, smiling, or other gestures. Therefore, the statement cannot be universally considered common sense as it relies on specific individual behavior and context. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 1884, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accomplishes max's task then max feels happy.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max accomplishes Max's task then Max feels happy\" is based on the idea that achieving goals or completing tasks leads to a sense of satisfaction or happiness. This is a common psychological phenomenon where accomplishing something one has set out to do can lead to positive emotions and a sense of fulfillment. The sense of achievement can boost self-esteem and overall contentment. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that if Max completes a task he has set for himself, it could contribute to his happiness.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1885, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accomplishes max's task then max feels proud.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max accomplishes Max's task then Max feels proud\" is based on the idea that achieving a goal or completing a task typically leads to positive emotions such as pride. This is a common psychological response as accomplishing tasks often leads to a sense of fulfillment and self-satisfaction. Feeling proud is a natural emotional outcome when someone perceives themselves as having successfully met their objectives or overcome challenges. Therefore, it can be considered as common sense that accomplishing a task would make Max feel proud, given that it aligns with general human emotional responses to success.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1886, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accomplishes max's task then sam wants to reward max.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max accomplishes Max's task then Sam wants to reward Max\" suggests a cause-and-effect relationship where the accomplishment of a task leads to a desire for reward. This is a logical and reasonable scenario, as it is common for individuals to want to reward or recognize others for successfully completing tasks or achieving goals. It aligns with general principles of positive reinforcement and appreciation, which are commonly observed in both personal and professional settings.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1887, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accomplishes max's work then max gets promoted.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If max accomplishes max's work then max gets promoted\" implies a direct correlation between job performance and career advancement. In many workplaces, consistently meeting or exceeding expectations can lead to promotions as a recognition of hard work and value to the company. However, promotions can also be influenced by other factors such as office politics, seniority, and availability of higher positions. Therefore, while the statement reflects a common ideal, it may not always hold true in practice. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 1888, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accomplishes max's work then max needs to engage their job.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement implies that in order for Max to accomplish his work, he needs to actively participate in his job. This suggests that engagement and involvement in one's job are necessary to fulfill work responsibilities and achieve goals. It is common sense that one must be engaged in their job to accomplish their tasks effectively; disengagement typically leads to poor performance or incomplete work. Therefore, the statement aligns with a logical understanding of job performance and responsibility. \n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1889, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accomplishes max's work then max wants to conclude their day.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max accomplishes Max's work then Max wants to conclude their day\" suggests that completion of tasks leads to a desire to end the workday, which is a reasonable assumption for most people. After fulfilling responsibilities or achieving goals, individuals generally feel a sense of satisfaction and may wish to rest or engage in non-work-related activities. This aligns with common human behavior to separate work time from personal time, especially after completing designated tasks.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1890, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accomplishes sam's objectives then max needs to come up with a plan.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max accomplishes Sam's objectives then Max needs to come up with a plan\" suggests that in order to achieve specific objectives, planning is necessary. This aligns with the common-sense understanding that effective planning is often essential for successfully reaching goals or completing tasks. Planning helps in organizing thoughts, resources, and actions needed to meet the desired outcome. Therefore, if Max wants to accomplish Sam's objectives, having a plan would be a practical and logical approach.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1891, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accomplishes sam's objectives then sam gets in trouble.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests a causal relationship between Max accomplishing Sam's objectives and Sam getting into trouble. Without knowing the specific objectives or the context in which they are being pursued, it is difficult to determine if this is common sense. If Sam's objectives are unethical or illegal, it would be common sense that accomplishing them could lead to trouble. However, if the objectives are benign, the statement would not necessarily hold true.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1892, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accomplishes sam's objectives then sam is left out.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max accomplishes Sam's objectives then Sam is left out\" does not seem to follow common sense because accomplishing someone's objectives typically implies helping them achieve their goals, not leaving them out. If Max is successfully meeting Sam's objectives, it would suggest cooperation and support rather than exclusion. The statement seems contradictory as achieving objectives generally leads to inclusion and satisfaction rather than being left out. Therefore, it does not align with common sense reasoning.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1893, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accomplishes sam's objectives then sam wants to chide max.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max accomplishes Sam's objectives then Sam wants to chide Max\" suggests that Sam would want to scold or criticize Max if Max successfully completes Sam's goals. This does not align with common sense, as typically, accomplishing someone's objectives would lead to praise or gratitude rather than criticism. The statement contradicts the usual positive response one would expect when their objectives are met.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1894, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accomplishes sam's work then max paid.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max accomplishes Sam's work then Max paid\" implies a cause-and-effect relationship where completing Sam's work leads to Max being paid. In typical work scenarios, a person is compensated for the work they perform. If Max is doing Sam's work, it's reasonable to expect that Max would be compensated for that effort, either by Sam directly or by an employer who is aware of the arrangement. However, without additional context about the agreement between Max and Sam, or the policies of their employment, it's not possible to definitively conclude that Max will be paid. Therefore, the statement relies on assumptions about the situation and might not be universally true in all contexts.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1895, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accomplishes sam's work then max wants to have employment.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max accomplishes Sam's work then Max wants to have employment\" suggests a connection between completing someone else's work and a desire for employment. The reasoning here could be that if Max is willing and able to do someone else's work, it may indicate a motivation or need for employment. However, it's also possible that Max could be helping Sam for reasons unrelated to wanting employment, such as friendship, favor, or volunteerism without any personal employment aspirations. The statement assumes a direct causality that might not universally apply.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1896, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accomplishes sam's work then sam feels happy.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max accomplishes Sam's work then Sam feels happy\" suggests that Sam derives happiness from Max completing his tasks. This could be a common scenario if Sam is overwhelmed or unable to complete the work himself, and Max's help alleviates stress or burden for Sam. However, this statement might not always hold true, as it assumes that Sam's happiness is solely dependent on his work being done by someone else, which may not be the case if Sam values personal achievement or has other sources of happiness.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1897, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accomplishes sam's work then sam wants to be appreciative.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement reflects a common social norm where individuals show gratitude when someone helps them or accomplishes a task on their behalf. It is a general expectation in many cultures that when someone does something beneficial for another person, the recipient of the help expresses appreciation. This helps maintain positive relationships and social harmony. Therefore, it is reasonable to consider the statement as aligning with common sense. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1898, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accomplishes sam's work then sam wants to reward max.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max accomplishes Sam's work then Sam wants to reward Max\" is based on the idea of reciprocation or gratitude. It is common for individuals to want to reward or thank someone who has helped them or completed a task on their behalf. Rewarding someone for their efforts can be seen as a gesture of appreciation and acknowledgment of the help provided. This is a typical social norm observed in various cultures, fostering positive relationships and encouraging cooperative behavior.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1899, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accuses sam of cheating then max intends to to get sam in trouble.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If max accuses sam of cheating then max intends to get sam in trouble\" assumes that the intention behind the accusation is to cause harm or trouble for Sam. However, it's possible that Max's intention could be driven by a sense of justice or a desire to uphold the integrity of a competition or exam, rather than a desire to specifically get Sam in trouble. Without knowing Max's motives, it's difficult to definitively say that the intention is to cause trouble. Therefore, it is not necessarily common sense to assume that the intention is to get Sam in trouble solely based on the accusation. \n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1900, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accuses sam of cheating then sam feels angry.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max accuses Sam of cheating then Sam feels angry\" is based on the idea that being falsely accused of something, especially cheating, can provoke a strong emotional response such as anger. This is because accusations can be perceived as attacks on one's character and integrity, leading to feelings of injustice and frustration. The assumption that Sam would feel angry in response to being accused by Max is reasonable, as it aligns with common human emotions and reactions in similar situations.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1901, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accuses sam of cheating then sam feels betrayed.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max accuses Sam of cheating then Sam feels betrayed\" suggests a cause-and-effect relationship where an accusation leads to feelings of betrayal. It is common for individuals to feel betrayed when they are accused by someone they trust or have a close relationship with, as accusations can lead to feelings of mistrust and emotional hurt. However, the exact emotional response can vary based on the individuals involved and the nature of their relationship.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1902, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accuses sam of cheating then sam felt guilty.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If max accuses sam of cheating then sam felt guilty\" does not necessarily align with common sense, as it presumes a direct correlation between accusation and guilt. Feeling guilty is a personal, internal response and can vary depending on the individual's values, beliefs, and the context of the situation. It is possible for someone to be accused of cheating and not feel guilty if they believe they are innocent or if they do not internalize the accusation. Similarly, a person might feel guilty without being accused if they are aware of their own wrongdoing. Therefore, the statement assumes a causal relationship that may not exist in all cases.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1903, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accuses sam of cheating then sam fight.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max accuses Sam of cheating then Sam fights\" implies a direct causal relationship between accusation and physical altercation, which may not necessarily be true in all cases. Human behavior is complex and can be influenced by various factors such as personality, context, and emotional state. It is possible for Sam to respond in different ways such as denying the accusation, seeking clarification, or discussing the matter calmly. Therefore, assuming that an accusation will always lead to a fight is an oversimplification of human behavior. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 1904, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accuses sam of cheating then sam scold.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If max accuses sam of cheating then sam scold\" does not necessarily align with common sense, as the reaction of \"scolding\" is not a guaranteed or predictable response to being accused of cheating. Different individuals may respond differently to accusations, such as denying the accusation, explaining their actions, or feeling upset. Scolding is typically a response associated with authority figures reprimanding someone for wrongdoing, rather than a reaction to being accused. The statement assumes a specific reaction without considering other possible responses.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1905, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max accuses sam of cheating then sam wants to feel sorry.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max accuses Sam of cheating then Sam wants to feel sorry\" may not necessarily be common sense, as it assumes a specific emotional reaction from Sam based on an accusation. People's reactions to accusations can vary widely depending on their personality, the nature of their relationship with the accuser, and the context of the accusation. Sam might feel sorry, but he could also feel indignant, angry, confused, or a range of other emotions. Therefore, the assumption that Sam would specifically want to feel sorry is not a universally predictable or common sense response.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1906, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max aces max's exam then max intends to to do well in school.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max aces Max's exam then Max intends to do well in school\" suggests a connection between Max's performance on an exam and his intentions regarding his education. If Max aces the exam, it implies a high level of understanding and preparation, which are typically aligned with a desire to succeed academically. Therefore, it is reasonable to infer that acing the exam could be an indication of Max's intention to do well in school. This assumption is based on the idea that individuals who perform well on assessments generally have a positive attitude towards their educational achievements. \n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1907, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max aces max's exam then max is proud.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max aces Max's exam then Max is proud\" is based on a logical cause-and-effect relationship between success and positive emotions. Generally, when someone performs well on an exam, especially if they achieve the highest possible score, it is natural for them to feel a sense of accomplishment and pride. This is a common emotional response as doing well in an exam validates one's efforts and understanding of the material, which tends to boost self-esteem and provoke pride. Therefore, this statement aligns with typical human behavior and emotions associated with achievement.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1908, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max aces max's exam then max is smart.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max aces Max's exam then Max is smart\" is a conditional statement that implies a cause-and-effect relationship between acing an exam and being smart. However, acing an exam could be due to various factors such as good memory, test-taking skills, or even cheating, which do not necessarily equate to being smart in a broader sense. Being smart encompasses a wide range of qualities including critical thinking, problem-solving, creativity, and emotional intelligence, which may not be fully measured by a single exam performance. Therefore, while acing an exam is an indicator of some abilities, it does not definitively prove that someone is smart in all aspects.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1909, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max aces max's exam then max needs go to school.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max aces Max's exam then Max needs to go to school\" seems to lack logical connection. Typically, acing an exam implies that the student, Max, has already attended school or engaged in studies to achieve such a result. The need to go to school is generally associated with preparing for or taking an exam, rather than being a consequence of having already aced it. Therefore, the statement does not align with common sense as the premise and conclusion seem unrelated.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1910, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max aces max's exam then max needs to go to the school.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max aces Max's exam then Max needs to go to the school\" seems to lack logical consistency. Commonly, if a student aces an exam, it implies that they have already attended school or the exam session. The need to go to school would typically be before taking the exam, not after already acing it. Therefore, the statement does not align with typical scenarios or common sense regarding the sequence of events in an academic setting. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 1911, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max aces max's exam then max needs to take practice tests.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement implies that taking practice tests is necessary for Max to ace his exam. This makes sense as practice tests can help Max better understand the material, identify areas where he needs improvement, and become more familiar with the exam format. Practice tests are a common study tool that many students use to prepare for exams effectively.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1912, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max aces max's exam then max passes class.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max aces Max's exam then Max passes class\" seems to suggest a logical connection between performing well on an exam and passing a class. Generally, acing an exam implies a high level of understanding and mastery of the course material, which typically contributes significantly to a student's overall grade in the class. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that if Max performs exceptionally well on the exam, he is likely to pass the class, assuming there are no other overriding factors such as other failed assignments or exams that could impact the final result. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1913, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max aces max's interview then max wants tell someone about it.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement implies that Max will feel excited or proud of his achievement in acing the interview, and as a result, he would want to share this positive news with someone else. It is a natural human behavior to share accomplishments or good news with others, as it can bring feelings of joy, validation, and connection. Most people tend to communicate their successes to friends, family, or colleagues. Therefore, the statement aligns with common human behavior and social norms.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1914, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max aces max's interview then sam wants take max to dinner.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max aces Max's interview then Sam wants to take Max to dinner\" appears to be a conditional statement that ties a specific outcome (Max acing an interview) to another person's (Sam's) response (wanting to take Max to dinner). Whether this is common sense or not would depend on the relationship between Max and Sam, their motives, and the context in which this event is happening. Common sense usually refers to practical, everyday knowledge or sound judgment that doesn't require specific expertise or detailed analysis. This statement seems more situational and contingent on specific interpersonal dynamics rather than being a matter of common sense. Hence, it's not something that can be broadly categorized as common sense universally. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 1915, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max aces max's interview then sam wants to put him to work.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max aces Max's interview then Sam wants to put him to work\" implies that if Max performs well in his interview, Sam, who is likely in a position of authority or decision-making, would want to hire him or assign him tasks. This is a common scenario in professional settings where performance in interviews often influences hiring decisions. It makes sense that performing well would lead to opportunities for employment or work assignments.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1916, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max aces the exam then max is educated.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max aces the exam then Max is educated\" suggests a correlation between acing an exam and being educated. While acing an exam can indicate a good understanding of the specific subject matter covered in the exam, it doesn't necessarily imply a broader sense of being educated in a well-rounded manner. Education encompasses a wide range of knowledge, skills, critical thinking, and understanding beyond performing well in a single test. Therefore, the statement might be an oversimplification.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1917, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max aces the test then max feels thrilled.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max aces the test then Max feels thrilled\" is based on the idea that performing well on a test generally leads to positive emotions like happiness or excitement. Acing a test is an achievement that can bring a sense of accomplishment and satisfaction, which are common reasons to feel thrilled. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that Max would feel thrilled if he aces the test, as this is a common emotional response to doing well in an evaluative situation.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1918, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max aces the test then max wants to learn more.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max aces the test then Max wants to learn more\" suggests a causal relationship between Max's performance on the test and his desire to learn more. However, acing a test does not necessarily imply that a person wants to learn more. It could be that Max studied effectively for the test and is satisfied with his performance, or he might be motivated by external factors such as grades rather than a genuine interest in learning. The desire to learn more is more closely related to intrinsic motivation and curiosity, which are not directly measurable by test performance alone.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1919, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max achieves max's aim then max feels proud.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If max achieves max's aim then max feels proud\" is generally aligned with common sense because it suggests that accomplishing a goal or aim often leads to a sense of pride. When individuals set goals for themselves and successfully achieve them, it is a natural emotional response to feel proud of their accomplishment. Pride is a positive emotion that arises from one's own achievements, reflecting satisfaction and fulfillment. Therefore, it makes sense that achieving an aim would elicit feelings of pride.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1920, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max achieves max's aim then max intends to to achieve a goal.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max achieves Max's aim then Max intends to achieve a goal\" is based on the idea that achieving an aim implies intentionality. If Max achieves an aim, it suggests that Max had a specific goal in mind and took actions to reach that goal. Intention is generally understood as a mental state that represents a commitment to carrying out an action or actions in the future. Therefore, if Max achieves an aim, it is reasonable to assume that Max had the intention to do so, as actions are typically driven by intentions. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1921, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max achieves max's aim then max needs to do their best.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If max achieves max's aim then max needs to do their best\" suggests that in order to achieve a specific goal or aim, max must put forth their best effort. This is based on the common understanding that success generally requires dedication, effort, and commitment. Achieving an aim typically involves overcoming challenges and obstacles, which necessitates doing one's best. Therefore, the statement aligns with the general principle that effort is correlated with success.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1922, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max achieves max's aim then max needs to have a plan.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If max achieves max's aim then max needs to have a plan\" suggests that in order to successfully achieve a goal or aim, there must be a structured approach or strategy in place. This idea aligns with common sense because having a plan provides clarity on the steps required to reach an objective, helps allocate resources efficiently, and allows for the measurement of progress. Without a plan, efforts can be disorganized and the likelihood of achieving the desired outcome decreases. Therefore, the statement reflects a logical approach to goal achievement.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1923, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max achieves max's aim then max needs to work hard.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that to achieve one's aim, particularly if it is a challenging goal, hard work is generally necessary. This aligns with the common understanding that success often requires effort and dedication. Therefore, the idea that Max needs to work hard to achieve his aim is consistent with the widely accepted principle that effort is often a prerequisite for achieving goals.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1924, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max achieves max's aims then max needs to be dedicated in work.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement implies that dedication in work is necessary for achieving one's aims, particularly when those aims are ambitious or require significant effort. Common sense suggests that dedication and commitment are key factors in successfully accomplishing goals, as they involve focus, perseverance, and consistent effort over time. Without dedication, it's likely that an individual will struggle to overcome obstacles or maintain the necessary drive to see tasks through to completion. Therefore, the idea that dedication is needed for Max to achieve his aims aligns with a generally accepted understanding of what it takes to succeed.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1925, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max achieves max's dream then max intends to to achieve the dream.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement implies that if Max achieves his dream, then it must have been his intention to do so. This is based on the idea that achieving a dream generally requires deliberate effort and planning, suggesting that Max must have intended to reach that goal if he successfully achieved it. Achieving a dream is not typically something that happens by accident or without any intention. Therefore, it is common sense to assume that if Max achieves his dream, he must have intended to achieve it.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1926, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max achieves max's dream then max needs to make a plan.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If max achieves max's dream then max needs to make a plan\" suggests that in order to achieve a specific dream or goal, it is necessary to have a plan in place. This is based on the idea that having a plan provides direction, structure, and steps to follow, which can increase the likelihood of success in achieving a desired outcome. Planning helps to organize resources, time, and efforts efficiently and effectively. This is a widely accepted principle in goal-setting and personal development.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1927, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max achieves max's dream then max needs to work hard.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that to achieve one's dream, hard work is necessary. This idea is generally accepted as common sense because dreams and goals typically require effort and dedication to be realized. Hard work provides the means to develop skills, overcome challenges, and make progress towards achieving the dream. Therefore, the statement aligns with the widely held belief that success and fulfillment of aspirations are often the result of consistent and diligent effort.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1928, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max achieves max's dream then max wants to achieve another dream.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement, \"If Max achieves Max's dream then Max wants to achieve another dream,\" suggests that once a person fulfills one dream or goal, they are likely to set their sights on a new ambition. This idea aligns with the common understanding of human nature and motivation. People are generally driven to seek out new challenges and experiences, and achieving one goal often serves as a stepping stone to pursuing further aspirations. This cycle of setting and achieving goals is a key part of personal growth and development.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1929, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max achieves max's ends then max wants to rest.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that after achieving a goal or completing tasks, an individual named Max would feel a desire to rest. This aligns with common human behavior, where exerting effort or achieving objectives can lead to feelings of fatigue and the need for recovery. Resting after completing tasks is a natural response to recharge and regain energy. This concept is relatable and understandable as it reflects a common pattern of behavior in goal-oriented activities.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1930, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max achieves max's ends then max yells.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If max achieves max's ends then max yells\" does not necessarily align with common sense, as there is no logical or natural connection between achieving one's goals and yelling. Achieving an end could lead to various reactions such as feeling satisfied, celebrating, or even remaining calm and composed. Yelling is just one possible reaction and is not a universally expected response. Therefore, the statement lacks a clear, rational link between the cause (achieving ends) and effect (yelling).\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1931, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max achieves max's goal then max needs to be working.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that to achieve a goal, one must put in effort and work towards it. This is generally true because goals typically require some level of action or effort to be accomplished. Without working towards the goal, it's unlikely that it would be achieved. Therefore, the statement aligns with common sense as it reflects the general understanding that effort is necessary to reach desired outcomes.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1932, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max achieves max's goals then max needs to write their goals down.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that writing down goals can be a helpful tool for achieving them. This is a common strategy recommended in goal-setting theory and productivity practices because it helps clarify objectives, track progress, and maintain focus. Research in psychology supports the idea that writing down goals can increase commitment and likelihood of achieving them. Therefore, the statement aligns with general advice on effective goal setting and attainment.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1933, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max achieves max's objective then max feels completed.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that achieving one's objective leads to a sense of fulfillment or completion. This idea is generally aligned with common human experiences, where reaching a goal often brings a sense of satisfaction and completeness. It is a psychological principle that accomplishing objectives can contribute to an individual's sense of purpose and well-being. Therefore, the statement aligns with a common understanding of human motivation and fulfillment. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1934, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max achieves max's objective then max feels satisfied.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests a cause-and-effect relationship between achieving an objective and feeling satisfied. Generally, when individuals set goals and successfully accomplish them, they experience a sense of fulfillment and satisfaction. This positive emotional response is tied to the achievement of desired outcomes and the intrinsic reward of personal accomplishment. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that when \"max\" achieves his objective, he would indeed feel satisfied, as this is a common psychological response.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1935, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max achieves max's objective then max intends to to accomplish a goal.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement implies a logical connection between achieving an objective and having an intention to accomplish a goal. When Max achieves his objective, it suggests that there was a purpose or aim behind his actions, which aligns with the idea of intending to accomplish a goal. It is common sense to assume that if someone achieves an objective, they likely had the intention to do so, as objectives are generally set with the purpose of being met through intentional actions. Therefore, the statement reflects a basic understanding of how intentions and objectives are related in goal-directed behavior.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1936, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max achieves max's objective then max needs to know the objective.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If max achieves max's objective then max needs to know the objective\" is based on the reasoning that in order to achieve a specific goal or objective, one must first be aware of what that objective is. This is because without knowing the objective, it would be impossible to take deliberate actions or make informed decisions that are aligned with achieving it. It's akin to trying to hit a target blindfolded; without knowing where the target is, the chances of hitting it are slim.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1937, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max achieves max's objective then max needs to set a goal.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If max achieves max's objective then max needs to set a goal\" suggests that achieving an objective requires having a goal in the first place. It is a logical necessity that in order to achieve something, one must have a clear aim or objective defined as a goal. Without setting a goal, there is no target to reach or measure success against. Therefore, the achievement of any objective inherently implies that a goal was set initially.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1938, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max achieves max's potential then max feels confident.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that achieving one's potential leads to increased confidence, which is a common psychological concept. When individuals reach their goals and fulfill their potential, it often results in a boost in self-esteem and self-assurance. This positive reinforcement can make them feel more confident in their abilities and future endeavors. Therefore, the statement aligns with the general understanding of the relationship between personal achievement and confidence. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1939, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max achieves max's potential then max feels satisfied.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that achieving one's potential leads to a sense of satisfaction. This is a common psychological belief, as fulfilling one's potential is often linked to self-actualization and personal fulfillment. When individuals reach their full potential, they are likely to experience a sense of accomplishment and contentment. Therefore, it is reasonable to say that achieving potential can lead to feelings of satisfaction.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1940, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max achieves max's potential then max intends to to be successful.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If max achieves max's potential then max intends to be successful\" implies that achieving one's potential is inherently linked to having the intention to be successful. Achieving one's potential generally means making the most out of one's abilities and resources, which in most contexts is aligned with striving for success. Therefore, the statement suggests that if someone fulfills their potential, they must have had the intention to succeed, as success is often the outcome of fully utilizing one's capabilities. This seems like a logical connection as typically, the motivation to reach one's potential stems from a desire to succeed in some manner. \n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1941, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max achieves max's potential then max wants to celebrate success.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that if someone named Max achieves their potential, they would want to celebrate their success. It is common for individuals to feel a sense of accomplishment and desire to celebrate when they reach their goals or fulfill their potential. Celebrating success can serve as positive reinforcement and motivation for future achievements. This is a typical human behavior that aligns with common sense as it reflects a natural emotional response to personal achievement.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1942, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max achieves max's purpose then max intends to to show off skills.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max achieves Max's purpose then Max intends to show off skills\" makes an assumption about Max's intentions based solely on the outcome of achieving a purpose. Intentions can vary widely depending on the individual and the context. Achieving a purpose does not necessarily imply that the intention was to show off skills; the purpose could be personal satisfaction, professional advancement, helping others, or any number of other motivations. Therefore, assuming that achievement of a purpose equates to an intention to show off skills is not a reasonable generalization and lacks common sense as it oversimplifies human motivations.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1943, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max achieves sam effect then sam feels happy.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max achieves Sam's effect then Sam feels happy\" implies that Sam's emotional state is dependent on Max's actions and success in replicating a desired outcome or effect. This assumes a level of influence and interdependence between Max and Sam, which could be reasonable if they have a close relationship or if Sam's happiness is directly tied to the effect being achieved. However, it is not universally common sense because individual emotions can be influenced by a variety of factors and may not solely depend on another person's actions. The context of their relationship and the nature of the \"effect\" are not specified, making it difficult to generalize as common sense.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1944, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max achieves sam end then max is smug.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If max achieves same end then max is smug\" is not necessarily common sense. The conclusion that Max is smug depends on Max's personality and attitude towards achieving a goal, and cannot be universally applied to everyone named Max or anyone achieving a goal. Being smug is a specific emotional response that not everyone may exhibit upon achieving a goal. Therefore, it is not common sense to assume that achieving a goal would automatically make someone smug. \n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1945, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max achieves sam end then sam feels scared.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max achieves Sam's end then Sam feels scared\" requires more context to determine if it is common sense. The relationship between Max and Sam, the nature of the \"end\" Max is achieving, and Sam's reasons for feeling scared all influence whether this statement makes sense. Without additional information, it is difficult to say if the statement is logically sound or based on common sense. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 1946, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max achieves sam goal then max wants to explain how they met the goals.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max achieves Sam's goal then Max wants to explain how they met the goals\" suggests a specific relationship between achieving a goal and the desire to explain the process of achieving it. However, this may not necessarily be true for everyone. The desire to explain the process of achieving a goal can vary depending on individual personalities, motivations, and the context of the situation. Some people might want to share their success and methods to help others or to celebrate, while others might prefer to keep it to themselves. Therefore, it is not a universally applicable statement.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1947, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max achieves sam goal then sam is patronized by max.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max achieves Sam's goal then Sam is patronized by Max\" implies that if Max successfully accomplishes a goal that was originally set by Sam, then Sam would be condescended to or treated as inferior by Max. This assumption, however, does not logically follow from the premise that Max achieved Sam's goal. Achieving someone else's goal could be a result of collaboration, assistance, or support rather than an act of patronization. Therefore, it is not common sense to assume that achievement of a goal leads directly to patronization.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1948, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max achieves sam goal then sam wants to give max an incentive.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max achieves Sam's goal, then Sam wants to give Max an incentive\" suggests that Sam has set a goal for Max, and if Max accomplishes that goal, Sam is motivated to reward Max. This kind of arrangement is commonly seen in various contexts such as employment, education, or personal relationships, where incentives are used as motivation to achieve specific objectives. Offering incentives is a typical way to encourage performance and recognize achievement.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1949, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max achieves sam goal then sam wants to set a higher goal for max.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that Sam sets higher goals for Max whenever Max achieves the initial goal set by Sam. This indicates a desire for continuous improvement and striving for greater achievements, which can be common in competitive or growth-oriented environments. It reflects a mindset of pushing limits and not settling for current accomplishments. However, whether this is common sense depends on the context and the relationship between Sam and Max. If Sam is a coach, mentor, or leader who is focused on Max's development, it could be seen as reasonable. On the other hand, continuously setting higher goals without acknowledging satisfaction or contentment at achievements might not be practical or healthy in all scenarios.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1950, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max achieves sam level then max gloats.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If max achieves sam level then max gloats\" is not necessarily common sense, as it relies on specific information about the character or behavior of \"max\" which may not be universally understood or agreed upon. Common sense typically involves widely accepted and easily understood principles or behaviors that are generally applicable to most situations or people. The statement in question assumes that \"max\" has a tendency to gloat when achieving something, which may not be a universally recognized trait. Therefore, it cannot be considered common sense without additional context about \"max.\"\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1951, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max achieves sam level then max intends to to have similar position as sam.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max achieves the same level then Max intends to have a similar position as Sam\" suggests a connection between Max's achievement and his intentions. Achieving the same level as Sam could mean reaching the same rank, status, or performance level in a given context. However, achieving the same level does not necessarily imply that Max intends to have a similar position as Sam. Max's motivations and intentions could be entirely different and unrelated to Sam's position, even if they achieve the same level. Max might be aiming for personal growth, different opportunities, or other goals that do not directly align with having a similar position as Sam.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1952, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max achieves sam level then max needs to work hard.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that in order to achieve a certain level of success or accomplishment (in this case, the level attained by Sam), Max needs to put in effort and work hard. This is based on the general understanding that success often requires dedication and hard work, especially when trying to reach the achievements of someone who has already set a high standard.\n\nReasonably, it is common sense that to reach any significant goal or match someone's level of achievement, effort and hard work are typically necessary. It aligns with the widely accepted belief that hard work is a key component to success.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1953, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max achieves sam level then max needs work hard.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that in order to achieve a certain level of success or proficiency, an individual named Max must put in effort and hard work. This aligns with the general understanding that success often requires dedication and effort. Therefore, the idea that hard work is necessary to achieve a desired level of accomplishment is a commonly accepted notion.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1954, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max achieves sam level then sam feels good.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max achieves Sam's level then Sam feels good\" suggests that Sam's emotional state is positively influenced by Max's achievement. This could be interpreted as Sam feeling good because he sees Max as a friend or peer and is happy for his success. Alternatively, it could mean that Sam feels validated or motivated by seeing someone else achieve the same level as him. However, without additional context about the relationship between Max and Sam, and what \"level\" they are achieving, it's not possible to definitively say if this is common sense. The emotional responses could vary greatly depending on individual personalities, the nature of their relationship, and the context of the achievement. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 1955, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max achieves sam objective then sam wants see what max did.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that if Max is successful in achieving an objective that Sam also aims for, then Sam would be interested in understanding Max's approach or methods in order to potentially replicate that success or learn from it. This is a logical and reasonable assumption, as people often look to successful examples for guidance and insight when pursuing similar goals. It is common for individuals to seek out successful strategies or techniques from others in order to improve their own chances of success. \n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1956, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max achieves sam objective then sam wants to show appreciation for max.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max achieves Sam's objective, then Sam wants to show appreciation for Max\" suggests that if Max helps Sam accomplish a goal, Sam would feel grateful and would want to express that gratitude. This aligns with general social norms and human behavior, where people appreciate when others help them achieve their goals and often show appreciation in return. Expressing gratitude can strengthen relationships and encourage further cooperation. Therefore, the statement reflects a common understanding of reciprocal social interactions.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1957, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max achieves sam understanding then sam feels informed.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max achieves Sam understanding then Sam feels informed\" implies a cause-and-effect relationship where Max's achievement in making Sam understand something leads to Sam feeling informed about that subject. This seems logical, as understanding typically leads to feeling informed. If someone comprehends a topic thoroughly, it is natural for them to feel knowledgeable or informed about that topic.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1958, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max acquires sam interest then sam listens attentively.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests a causal relationship between Max acquiring Sam's interest and Sam listening attentively. Common sense would dictate that if someone is engaged or interested in a topic being discussed, they are more likely to pay close attention. Therefore, if Max talks about something that interests Sam, it logically follows that Sam would listen more attentively.\n\nHowever, the statement's validity as common sense can depend on the interpretation of \"acquires interest.\" If it means Max shares the same interest as Sam, it makes sense that Sam would listen attentively. But if it implies something else, like Max trying to monopolize or control Sam's interest, the causality might not hold. Assuming the former, more straightforward interpretation, the statement aligns with common sense expectations of human behavior in social interactions.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1959, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max acquires sam knowledge then max intends to to be smarter.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max acquires Sam's knowledge then Max intends to be smarter\" suggests that Max's motivation for acquiring Sam's knowledge is to increase his own intelligence. This assumes that the intention behind gaining knowledge is always to enhance one's intellect, which may not always be the case. People may acquire knowledge for various reasons such as curiosity, necessity, or enjoyment, without necessarily aiming to be smarter. Therefore, the statement might not hold true in all situations, as intentions can vary.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1960, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max acquires sam knowledge then max intends to to do a better job.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max acquires Sam's knowledge then Max intends to do a better job\" implies that gaining knowledge from someone else will inherently lead to the intention of improving performance. This could be considered common sense if we assume that acquiring knowledge generally equips a person with better tools or insights to enhance their work. It suggests a positive relationship between knowledge acquisition and intention to improve. However, it's important to note that the intention to do a better job may not solely depend on acquiring knowledge; it can also be influenced by motivation, attitude, and the specific context in which the knowledge is applied.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1961, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max acquires sam knowledge then sam wants to teach max.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests a causal relationship between Max acquiring knowledge and Sam's willingness to teach Max. However, it assumes that Sam's motivation to teach is solely dependent on Max acquiring knowledge, which may not necessarily be the case. Sam's willingness to teach could be influenced by various factors such as personal interest, availability, or the nature of the relationship between Sam and Max. Additionally, the statement does not specify the type of knowledge or the circumstances under which Max acquires it, making it difficult to determine if the statement is universally applicable.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1962, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max acts as sam agent then max feels good.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If max acts as sam agent then max feels good\" is not necessarily common sense. This is because the statement assumes a specific emotional response (feeling good) from Max based solely on the action of acting as Sam's agent. Emotional responses can vary greatly depending on individual motivations, preferences, and circumstances. Without knowing more about Max's feelings towards being an agent or his relationship with Sam, it is difficult to conclude that acting as Sam's agent will inherently make Max feel good.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1963, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max acts as sam agent then sam feels happy.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max acts as Sam's agent then Sam feels happy\" implies a causal relationship between Max acting as an agent and Sam's emotional state. In reality, whether or not Sam feels happy would depend on various factors such as the context in which Max is acting as an agent, the outcomes of Max's actions, and Sam's expectations and personal circumstances. It is not necessarily common sense to assume that Sam would always feel happy just because Max is acting as his agent, as individual reactions can vary widely based on specific situations. Therefore, the statement cannot be universally considered as common sense. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 1964, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max acts as sam agent then sam gets an agent.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max acts as Sam's agent then Sam gets an agent\" is based on the logical implication that if one person (Max) performs the role or duties of an agent for another person (Sam), then the latter person (Sam) effectively has someone serving as their agent. The statement is straightforward in describing a cause-and-effect relationship where the action of one individual directly results in a benefit or status change for another individual. It aligns with the common understanding of what it means to have an agent, which is someone who represents or acts on behalf of another.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1965, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max acts as sam agent then sam wants get hired.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests a causal relationship between Max acting as Sam's agent and Sam's desire to get hired. It assumes that if Max represents Sam, it is because Sam is seeking employment opportunities. This is a reasonable assumption, as agents typically help their clients secure employment or contracts in various industries. Therefore, if Max is acting as Sam's agent, it's likely that Sam wants to get hired, which aligns with common sense expectations of the role of an agent.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1966, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max acts as sam agent then sam wants to thank max.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests a causal relationship between Max acting as Sam's agent and Sam wanting to thank Max. It assumes that if Max performs actions or services on behalf of Sam, then Sam would feel gratitude towards Max. This is a logical and reasonable assumption, as it is common for individuals to feel thankful when someone helps them or represents their interests in a positive way. Therefore, it aligns with general social norms and expectations about expressing gratitude for assistance.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1967, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max acts as sam intermediary then max feels confident.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If max acts as sam intermediary then max feels confident\" is not necessarily common sense. Confidence can be influenced by various factors such as personality, experience, and the specific situation. Acting as an intermediary does not automatically imply that someone will feel confident, as they might feel nervous or unsure about their role in facilitating communication or negotiation between parties.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1968, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max acts as sam intermediary then max wants to make both parties happy.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement implies that Max, as an intermediary, has an interest in ensuring both parties are satisfied. This aligns with the typical role of an intermediary, which is to facilitate communication and negotiation between parties to reach a mutually beneficial outcome. If Max wants to be effective in his role and maintain a positive reputation, it makes sense that he would strive to make both parties happy to achieve a successful resolution.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1969, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max acts as sam intermediary then sam feels annoyed.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement is not necessarily common sense because it involves subjective emotions and specific interpersonal dynamics that can vary depending on the individuals involved and the context of the situation. The feeling of annoyance is a personal reaction and can differ from person to person. Additionally, Max acting as an intermediary does not inherently lead to annoyance unless there are underlying issues or conflicts between Max and Sam. Therefore, it is not a universally understood or predictable outcome.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1970, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max acts as sam intermediary then sam feels at ease.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that Sam feels more comfortable when Max acts as an intermediary in a situation, possibly because Max helps facilitate communication or negotiation in a way that reduces stress or anxiety for Sam. This could be common sense if we assume that Max has qualities or skills that make him effective in this role, such as good communication skills, trustworthiness, or a calming presence. However, without further context about the relationship between Max, Sam, and the situation they are in, it's not possible to definitively say that this statement is common sense. Different individuals may have different reactions to intermediaries based on their personal experiences and the specific dynamics at play.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1971, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max acts as sam intermediary then sam feels calm.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max acts as Sam's intermediary then Sam feels calm\" implies that Sam's sense of calm is dependent on Max's role as an intermediary. This suggests that Sam may rely on Max to mediate or facilitate interactions, communication, or situations that might otherwise cause Sam stress or anxiety. However, whether this statement is common sense depends on the specific relationship dynamics and personalities of Max and Sam. If Max is particularly skilled at mediation and Sam tends to feel anxious in conflict situations, then the statement could be seen as common sense. Nevertheless, without specific information about their relationship or individual traits, it's difficult to definitively say that this statement is universally common sense.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1972, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max acts as sam intermediary then sam wants to thank max.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that if Max acts as an intermediary, helping to facilitate an interaction or transaction for Sam, then Sam would want to express gratitude for Max's assistance. In many social and cultural contexts, expressing thanks to someone who has helped you is considered polite and appropriate. Therefore, it is common for people to thank those who have acted in a helpful or intermediary role. \n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1973, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max acts funny then max feels staisfied.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If max acts funny then max feels satisfied\" is not necessarily common sense, as it makes an assumption about the relationship between behavior and emotional state that may not apply universally. Acting funny or humorous could be a way for someone to seek satisfaction, but it could also be a coping mechanism or a way to mask other feelings. Without more context about Max's personality, motivations, and circumstances, it is difficult to definitively say that acting funny leads to feeling satisfied for him. Therefore, the assumption made in the statement is not inherently common sense. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 1974, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max acts funny then max intends to to amuse someone.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max acts funny then Max intends to amuse someone\" suggests a direct correlation between Max's behavior and his intentions. It assumes that anytime Max acts in a humorous or funny way, his primary motivation is to entertain or amuse others. This interpretation relies on understanding Max's intentions based solely on his actions.\n\nHowever, people can act funny for various reasons other than intending to amuse someone. For example, Max might be acting funny as a coping mechanism, to hide his nervousness, or simply because he is in a good mood, without any specific intention to amuse others. The statement does not account for these alternative explanations and oversimplifies human behavior and motivation.\n\nGiven that human behavior can be complex and multifaceted, it is not necessarily common sense to assume that acting funny always equates to an intention to amuse. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 1975, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max acts funny then max intends to to be a comedian.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max acts funny then Max intends to be a comedian\" assumes a direct correlation between Max's behavior and his intentions, which may not necessarily be true. Acting funny could be a result of various factors such as Max's personality, social context, or even an accidental occurrence. It does not definitively imply that Max has a deliberate intention to pursue comedy as a profession. Therefore, it is not common sense to assume that acting funny directly equates to intending to be a comedian without further context or information about Max's motivations. \n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1976, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max acts funny then max is a comedian.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If max acts funny then max is a comedian\" implies a direct correlation between acting funny and being a comedian. However, acting funny does not necessarily mean that someone is a professional comedian. Many people can act funny without being comedians; they could simply have a good sense of humor or be in a playful mood. Being a comedian involves not only the ability to be funny but also involves performing comedy as a profession. Therefore, the statement makes an unfounded generalization.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1977, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max acts funny then sam wants to act funny too.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that Sam's behavior is influenced by Max's behavior, specifically that Sam wants to mimic Max when Max acts funny. This could be a result of admiration, peer pressure, or social conformity. It is common for people to imitate the behaviors of others they look up to or want to fit in with. However, without additional context about the relationship between Max and Sam or their individual personalities, it's not possible to definitively say this is always the case. Therefore, while the statement could be plausible in certain situations, it is not universally applicable as common sense. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 1978, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max acts in sam capacity then sam feels inspired.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max acts in Sam's capacity then Sam feels inspired\" implies a cause-and-effect relationship between Max's behavior and Sam's emotional response. The validity of this statement depends on the dynamics of Max and Sam's relationship, and whether Max's actions indeed have a motivational impact on Sam. Common sense would suggest that if Max's actions in Sam's role are positive, effective, and resonate with Sam's values or aspirations, then it's plausible for Sam to feel inspired. However, without specific context about their relationship or the nature of Max's actions, it is difficult to definitively conclude that this is a universal truth or common sense. Therefore, it is not necessarily common sense as it relies on specific interpersonal dynamics and individual responses.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1979, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max acts in sam manner then sam blushes.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If max acts in sam manner then sam blushes\" does not necessarily align with common sense, as it implies a direct cause-and-effect relationship between Max's actions and Sam's reaction, which might not always be the case. Blushing can be triggered by various emotions such as embarrassment, shyness, or excitement, and it is not universally caused by someone else's actions. Additionally, the statement does not consider other factors that might influence Sam's response, such as Sam's personality, the context of the situation, or their relationship with Max.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1980, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max acts in sam manner then sam gets embarrassed.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max acts in a manner similar to Sam, then Sam gets embarrassed\" suggests a cause-and-effect relationship between Max's behavior and Sam's emotional response. However, whether this statement is common sense depends on the specifics of the situation and the personalities involved. In general, it is not necessarily common sense to assume that one person will be embarrassed simply because another person acts like them. People have different thresholds for embarrassment and reactions to situations. Without additional context about the nature of the behavior or the relationship between Max and Sam, it is difficult to determine if this is a common-sense statement.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1981, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max acts in sam way then max is pushy.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max acts in Sam's way then Max is pushy\" suggests that Sam's behavior is generally perceived as pushy, and if Max adopts similar behavior, then he would also be considered pushy. Whether this statement is common sense depends on the context in which Sam's behavior is understood. If it is widely known and agreed upon that Sam's behavior is pushy, then it would be common sense to conclude that mimicking Sam's behavior would also make Max pushy. However, without specific information about Sam's behavior and the general perception of it, it's difficult to definitively say that this statement is common sense. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 1982, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max acts in sam way then max may get bumped for being in y way.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that if Max behaves similarly to Sam, who may be acting inappropriately or obstructively, then Max could face similar consequences such as being removed or \"bumped\" from a situation. This idea aligns with common sense as it reflects the principle that similar actions can lead to similar outcomes, especially in social or professional environments where certain behaviors are expected or rules are in place. Therefore, understanding that engaging in disruptive or negative behavior, like someone else known for such actions, can result in facing similar repercussions.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1983, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max acts like a man then max feels good.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If max acts like a man then max feels good\" is not necessarily common sense, as it relies on certain assumptions and stereotypes about what it means to \"act like a man\" and how that correlates to feeling good. The idea of acting like a man can vary greatly depending on cultural, societal, and individual perspectives, and feeling good is a subjective emotional state that can be influenced by numerous factors unrelated to gender expression. Thus, the statement oversimplifies the complex relationship between behavior, gender identity, and emotional well-being.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1984, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max acts like a man then max feels mature.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If max acts like a man then max feels mature\" suggests a correlation between behavior and feelings of maturity. While acting in a manner that is considered mature or \"manly\" could potentially influence one's self-perception and feelings of maturity, it is not a guarantee. Feelings of maturity can be influenced by a variety of factors including life experiences, emotional development, and personal values, which may not necessarily align with societal expectations of \"acting like a man.\" Therefore, the statement may not universally hold true for everyone as it assumes a direct and sole causation between acting like a man and feeling mature. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 1985, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max acts like a man then sam feels happy.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If max acts like a man then sam feels happy\" is not necessarily common sense because it relies on subjective interpretations of what it means to \"act like a man\" and assumes a direct correlation between one person's behavior and another person's emotional state. Happiness can be influenced by a multitude of factors and may not be directly tied to another person's actions or behavior. Additionally, the notion of \"acting like a man\" is a subjective and potentially stereotypical concept, which can vary greatly among different cultures and individuals. Therefore, the statement does not universally hold as a common-sense assertion. \n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1986, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max acts like a man then sam feels impressed.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If max acts like a man then sam feels impressed\" is not necessarily common sense, as it relies on subjective definitions of what it means to \"act like a man\" and assumes a specific emotional response from Sam. The idea of acting \"like a man\" can vary widely between different cultures and individuals, and the impression that it leaves on someone else, such as Sam, can also vary. Furthermore, it assumes a causal relationship between Max's behavior and Sam's feelings, which may not universally hold true. Without further context or clarification, this statement cannot be considered common sense as it is too vague and reliant on subjective interpretations.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1987, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max acts like men then sam wants to know why this happened.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If max acts like men then sam wants to know why this happened\" is not necessarily common sense because it involves assumptions about the behavior and motivations of the individuals named Max and Sam that are not universally understood or accepted. Common sense generally refers to beliefs or propositions that are widely held and easily understood by most people. Without more context about Max, Sam, their relationship, and the specifics of the situation, it is difficult to assess whether the statement reflects common sense. Additionally, the connection between Max acting like men and Sam wanting to know why is not a clear or logical causation that would be considered common sense. \n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1988, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max acts like men then sam wants to talk to x as a man.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If max acts like men then sam wants to talk to x as a man\" is not necessarily common sense. Common sense refers to sound practical judgment that is usually shared by many people. The statement includes a conditional relationship between Max acting like men and Sam wanting to talk to X as a man, which is not a universally understood or accepted notion. The connection between these two actions is not inherently obvious, and it relies on specific and personal interpretations of behavior and desires which may not be universally shared or recognized. Therefore, it does not align with the typical definition of common sense.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1989, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max acts like sam then sam feels annoyed.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max acts like Sam then Sam feels annoyed\" implies that Sam gets annoyed when Max mimics or imitates his behavior. This could be a common reaction as many people might feel frustrated or irritated when someone copies their actions or mannerisms, especially if it is perceived as mocking or intrusive. However, whether Sam actually feels annoyed would depend on his individual personality and their relationship dynamic. Without more context about their personalities and relationship, it's not possible to definitively say this reaction is common sense for everyone. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 1990, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max acts max's age then max intends to to be mature.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max acts his age then Max intends to be mature\" suggests a direct correlation between acting one's age and intending to be mature. However, acting one's age can mean different things depending on the context and doesn't necessarily imply an intention to be mature. People may act their age simply by exhibiting behaviors that are typical for their age group, which may or may not include maturity. Additionally, intention is an internal state that may not always be accurately inferred from external behavior. Therefore, it is not necessarily common sense to assume that acting one's age automatically equates to an intention to be mature. \n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1991, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max acts max's age then max wants be respected.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that if Max behaves appropriately for his age, then he desires respect. This implies that acting according to age-related expectations can lead to a desire for respect from others. It is common sense that behaving maturely and responsibly, which are often associated with acting one's age, can lead people to desire and potentially earn respect from others. Therefore, the statement aligns with general societal expectations and norms regarding behavior and respect. \n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1992, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max acts on max's behalf then sam feels relaxed.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If max acts on max's behalf then sam feels relaxed\" is not necessarily common sense, as it relies on specific and subjective interpersonal dynamics that are not universally understood or predictable. Common sense typically involves general knowledge or beliefs that are widely held and easily understood by most people. The statement suggests a cause-and-effect relationship between Max's actions and Sam's emotional state, which may not be intuitive or broadly applicable to everyone's understanding without additional context about the relationship between Max and Sam or the circumstances involved. Therefore, the statement is not inherently common sense.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 1993, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max acts on sam's behalf then max intends to be useful.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max acts on Sam's behalf then Max intends to be useful\" suggests that Max's actions are motivated by a desire to be helpful or beneficial to Sam. Acting on someone's behalf typically implies that the actions are taken with the intention of supporting or assisting that person. Therefore, it would be reasonable to assume that Max's intention in acting on Sam's behalf is to be useful to Sam.\n\nHowever, it's important to consider that intentions can be complex and multifaceted. While Max may intend to be useful, there could also be other intentions at play, such as gaining favor, fulfilling an obligation, or achieving personal gain. Nonetheless, the core intention when acting on someone's behalf is generally to provide some form of assistance or benefit.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1994, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max acts on sam's behalf then sam feels useless.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If max acts on sam's behalf then sam feels useless\" is not necessarily common sense, as it relies on assumptions about Sam's emotional state and his relationship with Max. Different individuals may respond differently to having someone act on their behalf. Some may feel relieved or grateful, while others might feel useless as suggested in the statement. However, without additional context about Sam's personality, his relationship with Max, and the specific circumstances, it is not possible to assume that this statement is universally true or common sense. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 1995, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max acts quickly then max feels anxious.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests a causal relationship between acting quickly and feeling anxious. While it is possible that acting quickly could lead to feelings of anxiety due to increased pressure or stress, it is not necessarily true for everyone. Different individuals may react differently to acting quickly, and some may not experience anxiety at all. Therefore, the statement is not universally applicable and cannot be considered common sense for everyone. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 1996, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max acts quickly then max feels excited.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max acts quickly then Max feels excited\" suggests a correlation between acting quickly and feeling excited. This could be reasonable in certain contexts where acting quickly is associated with adrenaline rushes or engaging in thrilling activities. However, it is not universally true as acting quickly could also be a result of stress, anxiety, or necessity, which might not necessarily lead to feelings of excitement. Therefore, it is not common sense to assume that acting quickly always leads to excitement without considering the specific circumstances. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 1997, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max acts strange then max is stared at.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max acts strange then Max is stared at\" implies a cause-and-effect relationship where unusual behavior attracts attention. In social contexts, people often notice and react to behavior that deviates from the norm, which can include staring. This response could be due to curiosity, concern, or disapproval. Therefore, the statement aligns with general observations about human behavior in social settings.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 1998, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max acts strange then max wants to feel unique.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If max acts strange then max wants to feel unique\" is not necessarily common sense, as it suggests a specific motive behind behavior without considering alternative explanations. Acting strange could be attributed to various factors such as stress, mental health issues, or simply a different personality, rather than a deliberate attempt to feel unique. Assuming that strange behavior is solely driven by a desire for uniqueness oversimplifies human behavior and ignores the complexity of individual motivations. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 1999, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max acts strange then sam feels confused.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If max acts strange then sam feels confused\" suggests a cause-and-effect relationship between Max's behavior and Sam's emotional response. This could be common sense if Max and Sam have a close relationship, and Sam is sensitive to changes in Max's behavior. However, without additional context about the nature of their relationship or Sam's typical reactions, it's not possible to definitively say that this statement reflects common sense universally. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 2000, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max acts strange then sam wants to know what's up with him.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement reflects a common scenario where one person is concerned about another person's unusual behavior, indicating care or curiosity. In relationships or friendships, it is natural for individuals to want to understand if something is wrong when someone behaves out of character. This concern can prompt someone to inquire about the well-being of the other person.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2001, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max acts upon sam then sam feel threatened.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max acts upon Sam then Sam feels threatened\" implies a cause-and-effect relationship where Max's actions lead to Sam feeling threatened. This statement could be considered common sense if Max's actions are aggressive or intimidating, as most people would naturally feel threatened in such situations. However, if Max's actions are neutral or friendly, it might not be common sense to assume that Sam would feel threatened. Without additional context about the nature of Max's actions, it's difficult to definitively say this statement is always common sense. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 2002, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max acts weird then max feels justified.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If max acts weird then max feels justified\" suggests that Max has reasons for his behavior that make sense to him, even if his behavior may seem odd to others. It is a common psychological phenomenon for individuals to have personal justifications for their actions, even if those actions are perceived as unusual. Therefore, it could be seen as common sense that Max would feel justified in his behavior if he is acting in a way that others might perceive as weird.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2003, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max adapts to max's environment then max intends to to be comfortable.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If max adapts to max's environment then max intends to be comfortable\" suggests a connection between adaptation and intention for comfort. Adapting to an environment can be seen as a way of making the surroundings more suitable for oneself, which in turn could lead to increased comfort. The intention to be comfortable can be a motivating factor for adapting. Thus, it seems reasonable to assume that if someone is adapting, they are likely doing so with the intention of achieving comfort. Therefore, this statement aligns with common sense as it reflects a logical connection between adapting behavior and seeking comfort.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2004, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max adapts to sam's environment then max becomes more flexible.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max adapts to Sam's environment then Max becomes more flexible\" suggests that by adapting to a new or different environment, Max is able to adjust his behaviors, habits, or thoughts to better suit that environment. Adaptation generally requires flexibility, as it involves being open to change and being able to navigate new circumstances. Therefore, it is logical to conclude that by adapting to Sam's environment, Max is demonstrating and potentially increasing his flexibility.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2005, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max addresses sam audience then sam feels happy.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max addresses Sam, audience then Sam feels happy\" implies that Sam's happiness is directly tied to being acknowledged or addressed by Max in front of an audience. This may not necessarily be true for everyone, as happiness can be influenced by a variety of factors and personal preferences. Additionally, the statement assumes a specific relationship or dynamic between Max and Sam that may not apply universally. Therefore, it is not necessarily common sense to assume that addressing someone in an audience will always make them happy.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 2006, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max addresses sam audience then sam hopes it's a good show.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max addresses Sam's audience, then Sam hopes it's a good show\" suggests that Sam has a vested interest in the quality of the presentation given by Max to his audience. It is reasonable to assume that Sam cares about the audience\u2019s experience and wants them to receive a good show, whether it is for reasons of reputation, audience satisfaction, or other motives. Therefore, it is common sense that Sam would hope for a positive outcome when someone else addresses his audience. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2007, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max adds butter then max intends to to make the cake taste better.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max adds butter then Max intends to make the cake taste better\" relies on the assumption that adding butter is a deliberate action taken to enhance the flavor of the cake. In many recipes, butter is known to add richness, moisture, and improve the overall taste. Therefore, if Max chooses to add butter, it is reasonable to infer that he is doing so with the intention of improving the taste of the cake. This is a common inference based on general knowledge about cooking and the role of butter in baking. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2008, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max adds fuel to the fire then max wants to cook some food on the fire.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If max adds fuel to the fire then max wants to cook some food on the fire\" suggests a direct correlation between adding fuel and cooking food. However, adding fuel to a fire can have multiple purposes beyond just cooking, such as providing warmth, light, or simply enjoying a fire. The statement assumes a specific intention (cooking) without considering other possibilities. Therefore, it does not necessarily align with common sense to assume that adding fuel to a fire implies a desire to cook food. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 2009, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max adds fuel to the fire then sam wants to be careful around max.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max adds fuel to the fire then Sam wants to be careful around Max\" implies that Max's actions could potentially exacerbate or intensify a situation. In this context, \"adding fuel to the fire\" is a metaphor for making a situation worse or more dangerous. Therefore, it would be common sense for Sam to exercise caution around Max to avoid further complications or hazards. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2010, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max adds insult to injury then max intends to to be in power.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max adds insult to injury then Max intends to be in power\" suggests a causal relationship between Max's actions and his intentions. Adding insult to injury generally means making a situation worse or more hurtful, and it does not necessarily imply an intention to be in power. One could add insult to injury for various reasons such as anger, spite, or lack of empathy, which are not directly related to an intention to be in power.\n\nThe statement implies that exacerbating a negative situation is a deliberate strategy to gain power, but this is not a common or necessary correlation. Intentions for power can manifest in many ways that do not involve hurting others further. Therefore, the statement oversimplifies human behavior and motivations.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 2011, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max adds insult to injury then sam feels sad.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If max adds insult to injury then sam feels sad\" suggests a cause-and-effect relationship where Max's actions result in Sam feeling sad. This could be interpreted as common sense if we assume that Sam is emotionally affected by Max's negative actions. Adding insult to injury typically means making a bad situation worse, which could understandably lead to someone feeling sad. However, without additional context about the relationship between Max and Sam, or Sam's emotional resilience, it's not guaranteed that Sam would always feel sad in response to Max's actions. Nevertheless, the general idea that hurtful actions can lead to sadness aligns with common sense about human emotions. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2012, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max adds salt then max intends to to improve the taste.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max adds salt then Max intends to improve the taste\" is based on the common understanding that salt is often used as a seasoning to enhance flavor in cooking. It is reasonable to assume that if someone adds salt to a dish, their intention is to improve its taste. Although there may be other reasons for adding salt, such as for preservation or texture enhancement, the primary and most widely recognized purpose of adding salt in a culinary context is to make the food taste better.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2013, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max adds salt then sam wants to enjoy the food.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max adds salt then Sam wants to enjoy the food\" is not necessarily a matter of common sense, as it involves subjective preferences and assumptions about individual tastes. The connection between adding salt and wanting to enjoy the food is not a universally applicable or logically necessary relationship. People's preferences for salt and their enjoyment of food can vary widely. Additionally, the statement assumes that Sam's enjoyment of food is directly influenced by Max's action of adding salt, which may not always be the case. Therefore, it is not a common sense statement as it does not hold true in all situations or for all individuals.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 2014, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max adds to max's collection then max wants to increase his collection.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement implies that Max's intention in adding to his collection is to increase its size. Generally, when someone adds items to a collection, it is reasonable to assume that they want the collection to grow. Therefore, the statement aligns with common sense expectations about why someone would add to a collection.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2015, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max adds to max's collection then sam organizes collection.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If max adds to max's collection then sam organizes collection\" does not necessarily follow common sense reasoning because there is no inherent logical connection between Max adding to his collection and Sam organizing the collection. Without additional context or information about the relationship between Max and Sam or any agreement or obligation they may have, it is not reasonable to assume that Sam would organize the collection simply because Max adds to it. Therefore, this statement cannot be considered common sense.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 2016, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max adds to max's collection then sam wants to admire their collection.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max adds to Max's collection then Sam wants to admire their collection\" suggests a cause and effect relationship between Max adding to their collection and Sam's desire to admire it. This relationship is not necessarily common sense, as it relies on specific preferences and motivations of the individuals involved, Sam and Max, that are not universally applicable or predictable. Personal interests and reactions can vary widely, so without knowing more about Sam and Max's interests and their relationship, it's not possible to determine if this statement is common sense. \n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 2017, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max adds to max's knowledge then max feels caring satisfied proud about contributing to sam intellectual growth progress.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement implies that Max feels positive emotions such as caring, satisfaction, and pride when he contributes to Sam's intellectual growth and progress. This is based on the idea that helping others and seeing them benefit from one's actions can lead to a sense of fulfillment and emotional reward. It is common for individuals to feel good when they positively impact someone else's life, especially in an intellectual or educational context. Therefore, the statement reflects a natural human response to altruistic behavior.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2018, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max adds to max's knowledge then max intends to to always learn new things.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If max adds to max's knowledge then max intends to to always learn new things\" suggests that by actively acquiring knowledge, Max demonstrates an intention to continuously learn. This could be considered common sense because the act of seeking and adding knowledge implies a desire to keep learning. If Max did not intend to learn new things, he would likely not engage in activities that expand his knowledge base.\n\nHowever, it's also possible that Max is adding to his knowledge for reasons other than a continuous intention to learn, such as for a specific short-term goal or requirement. In this case, the statement may not hold.\n\nOverall, the statement makes a reasonable assumption based on common interpretations of behavior and intention, but it does not account for all possible scenarios or motivations. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 2019, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max adds water then max feels satisfied.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If max adds water then max feels satisfied\" is not necessarily common sense because it lacks context and specificity. It assumes a direct correlation between adding water and feeling satisfied, but does not specify why adding water would lead to satisfaction. It could be possible that Max is feeling satisfied because he is thirsty and adding water quenches his thirst. However, without further information on the circumstances or Max's needs, it is difficult to determine whether this statement is universally true or applicable in all situations. Satisfaction can be influenced by various factors and may not solely depend on adding water.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 2020, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max adjusts sam's glasses then max intends to to see clearly.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max adjusts Sam's glasses then Max intends to see clearly\" implies that Max's intention for adjusting Sam's glasses is for his own benefit of seeing clearly. However, it's possible that Max is adjusting Sam's glasses for Sam's benefit, to help Sam see clearly, rather than for himself. Additionally, Max could be adjusting the glasses for other reasons, such as to clean them or to fix them, without any intention related to seeing clearly. Therefore, the statement makes an assumption about Max's intentions that may not necessarily be true.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 2021, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max adjusts sam's glasses then sam can now see.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max adjusts Sam's glasses then Sam can now see\" implies that Sam's glasses needed adjustment in order for Sam to see properly. If Max successfully made the correct adjustments to the glasses, it is reasonable to expect that Sam's vision would improve as a result. This is based on the common understanding that properly fitted and adjusted glasses can correct vision issues. Therefore, the statement aligns with common sense, assuming that the adjustments made were appropriate and effective for Sam's vision needs. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2022, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max adjusts sam's glasses then sam wants to drive to the the interview.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement does not appear to be common sense because there is no clear logical connection between Max adjusting Sam's glasses and Sam wanting to drive to an interview. Adjusting someone's glasses typically involves making them fit better or improving vision, but it does not directly influence a person's desire or decision to drive to a specific destination such as an interview. The two events seem unrelated and do not necessarily follow from one another in a cause-and-effect relationship.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 2023, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max admires sam's work then max intends to to praise sam.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max admires Sam's work then Max intends to praise Sam\" is based on the assumption that admiration leads to an intention to praise. In many cases, when someone admires another person's work, they may feel compelled to express their positive feelings and offer praise as a form of acknowledgment and encouragement. However, it's important to note that this isn't always the case; individual differences in personality, communication style, or the specific context could influence whether admiration directly leads to the intention to praise. Despite these factors, in general, it is reasonable to expect admiration to be associated with positive intentions like praising.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2024, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max admires sam's work then sam blushes.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max admires Sam's work then Sam blushes\" is contingent on individual personalities and reactions. Admiration doesn't necessarily lead to blushing for everyone, as blushing is a physiological response that can be triggered by various emotions, including embarrassment, shyness, or pleasure. The connection between admiration and blushing is not a universal or common sense truth, as it heavily depends on how Sam personally reacts to compliments or admiration. Therefore, it's not a statement that can be considered as common sense which is generally applicable or predictable.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 2025, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max admires sam's work then sam feels good.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max admires Sam's work then Sam feels good\" is based on the idea that receiving admiration or positive feedback for one's work generally leads to positive emotions. It is common for individuals to feel validated and appreciated when their efforts are recognized, which in turn boosts their mood and self-esteem. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that if Max admires Sam's work, it would likely result in Sam feeling good, as it aligns with typical human emotional responses to appreciation.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2026, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max admires sam's work then sam gains a follower.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests a causal relationship between Max admiring Sam's work and Sam gaining a follower. It is reasonable to assume that if someone admires another person's work, they might choose to follow them on social media or support them in some other way, thereby becoming a follower. However, the statement doesn't necessarily account for other variables such as Max already being a follower or choosing not to follow for other reasons. Despite these possibilities, the general idea that admiration can lead to gaining a follower is a logical and common assumption. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2027, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max admires sam's work then sam wants to show max other works from sam.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests a natural and positive response in a social interaction. If Max admires Sam's work, it is likely that Sam would feel encouraged and motivated to share more of their work with Max. This kind of response could help to strengthen the relationship and foster further admiration and collaboration. It is a common reaction for individuals to want to share more of their work when they receive positive feedback.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2028, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max admits sam was wrong then max intends to to inform sam.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max admits Sam was wrong, then Max intends to inform Sam\" involves assumptions about Max's intentions based on his actions. Admitting that someone was wrong does not necessarily imply an intention to inform that person about the admission. People may admit something internally or to a third party without necessarily having the intention to communicate that admission to the person it concerns. The statement presupposes a specific intention that isn't necessarily a common or natural consequence of the action described. Therefore, it is not necessarily common sense to assume that admitting someone's mistake directly leads to an intention to inform them about it.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 2029, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max admits sam was wrong then max needs witness.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max admits Sam was wrong then Max needs a witness\" implies that Max's admission requires external validation or corroboration from a third party. In many situations, a person's admission or acknowledgment of someone else's wrongdoing does not necessarily require a witness. An individual can admit to another's wrongdoing based on personal knowledge, observation, or belief without needing someone else to confirm it. Therefore, the statement does not align with common sense, as it suggests a requirement for a witness that may not be necessary in all circumstances. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 2030, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max admits sam was wrong then sam feels ashamed.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max admits Sam was wrong then Sam feels ashamed\" is not necessarily common sense, as it relies on specific assumptions about the emotional reactions of the individuals involved. The reaction of feeling ashamed is subjective and can vary greatly between individuals and situations. Some people may not feel ashamed even if someone else admits they were wrong, while others might feel ashamed regardless of external admissions. Therefore, it is not a universally applicable or predictable outcome.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 2031, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max adopts a baby then max feels caring.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max adopts a baby then Max feels caring\" implies a cause-and-effect relationship between adopting a baby and feeling caring. While adopting a baby can certainly foster feelings of care and responsibility, it's not necessarily true that everyone who adopts a baby will automatically feel caring. The experience and emotions can vary greatly depending on individual circumstances, personality, and external support. Therefore, it's not accurate to generalize that adopting a baby will always lead to feeling caring. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 2032, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max adopts a baby then max feels loving.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max adopts a baby then Max feels loving\" implies a cause-and-effect relationship between adopting a baby and feeling loving. While adopting a baby can often lead to feelings of love and attachment, it is not a guaranteed outcome for everyone. Individual experiences, emotional readiness, and personal circumstances can influence how someone feels after adopting a child. It is not universally true that adopting a baby will always result in feelings of love. Therefore, the statement cannot be considered common sense as it does not account for the variability in human emotions and experiences.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 2033, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max adopts a baby then max intends to to become a parent.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max adopts a baby then Max intends to become a parent\" implies a logical connection between the action of adopting a baby and the intention to become a parent. Adopting a baby is a significant and deliberate decision that generally involves a legal process and a commitment to take on the responsibilities of raising a child. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that if someone chooses to adopt a baby, they are doing so with the intention of becoming a parent and taking on those responsibilities. This assumption aligns with common sense understanding of the implications and commitments associated with adoption. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2034, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max adopts a cat then max feels excited.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max adopts a cat then Max feels excited\" implies a cause-and-effect relationship where adopting a cat leads to excitement. This could be considered common sense if we assume that Max likes cats and has positively anticipated the adoption. Generally, adopting a pet can be an exciting experience for many people, especially if they have been looking forward to it. However, without more context about Max's feelings towards cats or pets in general, it's not possible to definitively determine if the statement would be true for every individual named Max. Despite this, considering the general joy associated with pet adoption, it is reasonable to assume excitement as a common reaction.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2035, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max adopts a cat then max intends to to have companionship.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max adopts a cat then Max intends to have companionship\" implies that the motivation for adopting a cat is to gain companionship. This is a reasonable assumption, as many people adopt pets for companionship and the emotional benefits they provide. Additionally, cats are known to be social animals that can offer affection and companionship to their owners. While there could be other reasons for adopting a cat, such as for pest control or as a gift for someone else, the intent of companionship is a common and logical motive. \n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2036, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max adopts a child then max intends to to feel love.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max adopts a child then Max intends to feel love\" suggests a direct correlation between Max's intention to adopt a child and his intention to feel love. Common sense would dictate that individuals often adopt children with the intention of forming loving, familial relationships, which include feelings of love. However, it's important to consider that individuals might adopt for various reasons beyond just the desire to feel love, such as providing a home for a child in need, fulfilling personal or familial goals, or even societal pressures. Thus, while feeling love might be a common outcome or hope, it is not necessarily the sole intent behind every adoption.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 2037, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max adopts a child then max intends to to have a child.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max adopts a child then Max intends to have a child\" implies a logical connection between the action of adopting a child and the intention behind it. Adopting a child is a deliberate and planned decision that requires significant consideration and commitment. It is not something that typically occurs by accident or without forethought. Therefore, it makes sense to conclude that if Max adopts a child, it is because Max has the intention to have a child and is actively choosing to take on the responsibilities of parenthood. Adoption is a way of fulfilling the desire to parent a child, which indicates a clear intention to have a child. \n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2038, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max adopts a child then sam feels wanted.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max adopts a child then Sam feels wanted\" does not necessarily follow common sense as it involves two separate individuals whose emotions and actions may not be directly related. Adopting a child is a significant decision and action that primarily affects the individuals directly involved in the adoption process, namely Max and the adopted child. Sam's feeling of being wanted may not be directly influenced by this event unless further context is provided that establishes a connection between Max's action and Sam's emotional state. Without additional information linking these two outcomes, the statement seems arbitrary. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 2039, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max adopts a kitten then max intends to a companion.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max adopts a kitten then Max intends to have a companion\" suggests a logical connection between adopting a kitten and wanting companionship. Generally, people adopt pets because they desire companionship, emotional support, or to care for another living being. Adopting a kitten implies a willingness to take on the responsibility of caring for a pet, which commonly aligns with the intention of having a companion. Therefore, it can be considered common sense to assume that if Max adopts a kitten, he likely intends to have a companion. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2040, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max adopts a kitten then sam wants thank max for adopting their kitten.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement implies that Sam is grateful to Max for adopting a kitten, possibly because Sam cares about the well-being of kittens and is happy to see one being given a home. Expressing gratitude for someone's actions that align with one's values or desires is a common and sensible reaction. Therefore, the statement reflects a typical and understandable human response.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2041, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max adopts a new cat then max intends to to have a pet.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max adopts a new cat then Max intends to have a pet\" is based on the assumption that adopting a cat implies a deliberate action to take care of and be responsible for the animal. Adopting a pet generally suggests a desire or intention to have a pet, as it is a conscious decision to bring an animal into one's home and life. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that if Max adopts a cat, it indicates his intention to have a pet. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2042, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max adopts a new cat then sam wants to welcome the cat.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max adopts a new cat then Sam wants to welcome the cat\" involves assumptions about the behavior and preferences of Sam. Without additional context about Sam's feelings towards cats or Max's decision to adopt one, it's difficult to determine if it is common sense. Common sense usually involves general knowledge or beliefs that are widely held, and personal preferences about pets can vary greatly between individuals. Therefore, it cannot be assumed as common sense that Sam would want to welcome the cat just because Max adopts one.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 2043, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max adopts a pet then max intends to to have a companion.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max adopts a pet then Max intends to have a companion\" implies that the motivation behind adopting a pet is companionship. In many cases, this is a common reason for adopting a pet, as people often seek the company, affection, and emotional support that pets can provide. However, there could be other reasons for adopting a pet, such as for security, assistance, or even as a gift for someone else. Therefore, while the statement could be true in many situations, it is not universally applicable to all cases of pet adoption. \n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 2044, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max adopts one then max intends to to care for something.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that if Max adopts something, he intends to take responsibility for its care. This is a reasonable assumption because adoption generally implies a commitment to provide for and look after the adopted individual or item, whether it's a pet, a child, or something else. It reflects a basic understanding of the responsibilities associated with adoption.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2045, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max adopts sam approach then max intends to compromise.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that adopting \"Sam's approach\" is synonymous with an intention to compromise. Without knowing the specifics of Sam's approach, it's difficult to definitively conclude that it involves compromise. However, if we assume that Sam's approach is commonly understood to involve compromise, the statement would make sense. If adopting Sam's approach means following a method known for seeking middle ground or agreement, then it is logical to infer that Max intends to compromise by adopting such an approach. Therefore, the statement relies on the assumption that Sam's approach is indeed one of compromise.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2046, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max adopts sam approach then sam wants make sure he does it right.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement implies that Sam values doing things correctly and wants Max to adopt the same approach if Max chooses to emulate Sam's methods. It is common sense that someone who takes pride in their methods would want others who follow their lead to maintain the same standard of quality. Therefore, the statement reflects a natural and logical expectation that someone would want their approach to be replicated accurately and effectively.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2047, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max adopts sam policy then max intends to to be successful.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that if Max adopts Sam's policy, then Max has an intention to be successful. It assumes that adopting Sam's policy is a strategic decision made with the intention of achieving success. This could be considered common sense if Sam's policy is known to be effective or if it has a track record of leading to success. It is reasonable to assume that someone would adopt a policy with the intention of achieving positive outcomes. However, without additional context about the nature of Sam's policy or Max's specific goals, it is difficult to definitively say that this is always common sense. Nonetheless, the general idea that adopting a policy is done with the intention of success is a logical assumption. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2048, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max adopts the cat then max intends to to affectionate.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that if Max adopts the cat, he has intentions of being affectionate towards it. It assumes a direct correlation between adoption and a desire to show care and affection.

Therefore, it aligns with common sense to assume that if Max adopts the cat, he intends to be affectionate towards it. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2049, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max adopts the puppy then sam wants to play with the puppy.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max adopts the puppy then Sam wants to play with the puppy\" involves assumptions about the behavior and preferences of Sam. Without knowing Sam's specific feelings about puppies or animals in general, it's difficult to determine if it is common sense to assume Sam would automatically want to play with a puppy just because Max adopted it. People's interests and reactions to pets can vary greatly. Therefore, the statement cannot be universally regarded as common sense without additional context about Sam's disposition towards puppies. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 2050, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max advances max's interests then max feels satisfied.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If max advances max's interests then max feels satisfied\" is based on the idea that individuals generally feel content or fulfilled when their personal goals or desires are met. Advancing one's interests typically involves taking actions that align with personal objectives or preferences, which often leads to a sense of satisfaction or accomplishment. Therefore, it is logical to assume that if Max is successful in pursuing his interests, he is likely to experience feelings of satisfaction as a result. This is a common psychological response as personal fulfillment is closely tied to achieving one's aims. \n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2051, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max advances max's interests then max pursues another interest.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that if Max acts in his own self-interest, he will then pursue a different interest. This reasoning can be seen as not entirely common sense because it implies a contradiction. If Max is advancing his own interests, it would be logical for him to continue pursuing those same interests rather than switching to another. The idea that someone would abandon their interests after advancing them appears counterintuitive and does not align with typical rational behavior where individuals consistently work towards their personal goals and interests.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 2052, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max advances toward sam then max feels happy to see a friend.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max advances toward Sam then Max feels happy to see a friend\" suggests a positive emotional response from Max upon seeing Sam, implying that they have a friendly relationship. In general, when people see friends, they typically feel happy due to the positive associations and bonds they share. Therefore, it is reasonable to consider this a common-sense statement, as it aligns with typical human emotional responses in social interactions.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2053, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max advances toward sam then sam feels happy.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max advances toward Sam then Sam feels happy\" implies a cause-and-effect relationship where Max's action directly leads to Sam's emotional response. Without additional context about the relationship between Max and Sam, their emotional states, and the circumstances of Max's approach, it is difficult to determine if this statement is common sense. Emotions can vary greatly between individuals and situations, making it hard to generalize a specific reaction like happiness from one person's action.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 2054, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max advances toward sam then sam gets scared.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max advances toward Sam then Sam gets scared\" implies a cause-and-effect relationship where Max's action causes Sam to feel scared. This statement could be considered common sense if there is an established context where Max is known to be threatening or intimidating to Sam, or if Sam has a history of being fearful in similar situations. However, without additional context about the relationship between Max and Sam, or the nature of Max's advance, it's not possible to definitively say that it's common sense that Sam would get scared. Fear is a subjective response and can vary greatly depending on individual experiences and perceptions.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 2055, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max advances toward sam then sam runs away.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max advances toward Sam then Sam runs away\" implies a cause-and-effect relationship where Sam's reaction (running away) is triggered by Max's action (advancing toward him). This could be common sense if we assume that Sam perceives Max as a threat or is afraid of him. However, without additional context about the relationship between Max and Sam, their personalities, or the situation, it's not possible to definitively say that this reaction is common sense. Different scenarios could lead to different reactions from Sam. \n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 2056, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max advances towards sam then max feels affectionable.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If max advances towards sam then max feels affectionable\" suggests that Max's action of moving towards Sam indicates Max's feeling of affection. However, it's not necessarily common sense to assume that advancing towards someone always equates to feeling affectionate. Max could be advancing towards Sam for various other reasons such as anger, curiosity, or necessity. The statement makes an assumption about Max's internal feelings based solely on an external action, which may not always hold true.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 2057, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max advances towards sam then max intends to to get closer.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max advances towards Sam then Max intends to get closer\" implies a direct relationship between Max's action of advancing and his intention of closing the distance between himself and Sam. In general, advancing towards someone typically suggests an intention to reduce physical distance. Therefore, it is common sense to deduce that if Max is moving towards Sam, his intention is likely to get closer to Sam.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2058, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max advances towards sam then sam feels good.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max advances towards Sam then Sam feels good\" is not necessarily common sense because it assumes that Sam has a positive response to Max's actions without considering the context or the nature of their relationship. The statement is too generalized and does not account for individual differences in preferences, feelings, or circumstances. Additionally, Sam's feelings could be influenced by various other factors that are not mentioned in the statement. \nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 2059, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max advances towards sam then sam feels happy.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max advances towards Sam then Sam feels happy\" is not necessarily common sense because it assumes that Sam's emotional response to Max's approach is always positive. However, without knowing the nature of the relationship between Max and Sam, or Sam's personal feelings towards Max, it's impossible to determine if Sam would indeed feel happy. The statement does not account for various scenarios such as Sam feeling threatened, uncomfortable, or indifferent towards Max, which could lead to different emotional responses. Therefore, it is not a universally applicable assumption.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 2060, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max advances towards sam then sam is yelled at.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If max advances towards sam then sam is yelled at\" does not necessarily align with common sense, as it implies a direct cause-and-effect relationship between Max's actions and Sam being yelled at without considering other factors. It suggests that Max's mere act of moving towards Sam automatically results in Sam being yelled at, which is not a typical or expected outcome in most situations. Other variables, such as the context of their interaction, the intentions of Max, and the presence of other individuals, would influence whether or not Sam is yelled at. The statement lacks information to reasonably conclude that Sam being yelled at is a definite consequence of Max's advance.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 2061, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max advances towards sam then sam wants to embrace max.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max advances towards Sam then Sam wants to embrace Max\" is not necessarily common sense, as it makes an assumption about Sam's intentions and feelings without any additional context. Common sense would suggest that the reaction of wanting to embrace someone would depend on various factors such as the nature of their relationship, Sam's feelings towards Max, and the circumstances of the situation. Without knowing these details, it is not reasonable to assume that Sam would automatically want to embrace Max just because Max advances towards him.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 2062, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max advances towards sam then sam wants to talk to max.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max advances towards Sam then Sam wants to talk to Max\" assumes a direct correlation between Max approaching and Sam's desire to communicate. However, this may not always be true as Sam's willingness to talk could depend on various factors such as his mood, the nature of their relationship, or the context of the situation. Just because Max advances towards Sam does not necessarily mean that Sam wants to engage in conversation. \n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 2063, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max advances upon sam then sam feels obtainment.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If max advances upon sam then sam feels obtainment\" is not necessarily common sense, as it relies on specific and subjective interpretations of \"advances\" and \"obtainment.\" Without further context, it's unclear what \"advances\" means\u2014whether it's a physical, emotional, or professional advance\u2014and how it directly correlates to Sam's feeling of \"obtainment,\" which could refer to a sense of achievement, gain, or fulfillment. The causal relationship between these two actions is not inherently logical or universally understood, making it not common sense. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 2064, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max advances upon sam then sam wants too defend themselves.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max advances upon Sam then Sam wants to defend themselves\" is based on a natural instinct of self-preservation. In a situation where one feels threatened or attacked, it is typical for an individual to want to protect themselves and ensure their safety. This reaction can be seen as a common response in both humans and animals when faced with danger or aggression. Therefore, it aligns with general understanding and expectation of behavior in such circumstances.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2065, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max advertises max's business then max feels good for trying.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If max advertises max's business then max feels good for trying\" suggests a positive emotional response to taking action in promoting one's own business. It is common for individuals to feel a sense of accomplishment or satisfaction when they actively engage in activities that could potentially benefit their business or personal goals. Advertising is a proactive step in attracting customers and growing a business, and feeling good about making that effort is a natural psychological response. Therefore, the statement aligns with general understanding of human behavior and motivation in a business context. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2066, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max advertises sam's business then max needs to be an advertising agent.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If max advertises sam's business then max needs to be an advertising agent\" may not necessarily be common sense. Advertising can be done by anyone, not just professional advertising agents. For example, a friend or family member could help advertise a business through word-of-mouth or social media without being a professional agent. Additionally, business owners themselves often take on the role of advertising their own businesses without hiring an agent. The requirement for Max to be an advertising agent in order to advertise Sam's business is not inherently implied by the act of advertising itself. Therefore, it is not common sense to assume that Max must be an advertising agent just because he advertises Sam's business.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 2067, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max advertises sam's business then sam gets more customers.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests a causal relationship between advertising and increased customers, which is a common marketing principle. Advertising is generally intended to increase visibility and attract more customers by promoting a business's products or services. If Max effectively advertises Sam's business, it could indeed lead to more customers as more people become aware of Sam's offerings. Therefore, the statement aligns with general marketing strategies and principles that are widely understood.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2068, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max advertises sam's business then sam gets more sales.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests a causal relationship between advertising and increased sales, which is a common marketing principle. Advertising is generally intended to increase visibility and attract more customers, which can lead to increased sales. Therefore, if Max effectively advertises Sam's business, it is reasonable to expect that Sam may experience a boost in sales. However, the actual increase in sales would depend on various factors including the quality and reach of the advertisement, the appeal of the business's products or services, and market conditions. Despite these variables, the basic premise that advertising can lead to more sales is a widely accepted concept.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2069, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max advertises sam's business then sam wants to attract more customers.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement implies a cause-and-effect relationship where Max's advertising of Sam's business leads to Sam's desire to attract more customers. Commonly, businesses advertise to increase their visibility and attract more customers. If Sam's business is being advertised by Max, it suggests that Sam is already interested in gaining more customers, as that is typically the purpose of advertising. Therefore, the statement aligns with common sense understandings of business marketing and growth strategies.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2070, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max advises sam to go then max intends to to avoid a fight.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max advises Sam to go then Max intends to avoid a fight\" suggests that Max's advice is motivated by a desire to prevent a conflict. This could be considered common sense if we assume that advising someone to leave a situation is often a way to de-escalate tension and reduce the likelihood of a fight. Additionally, the statement implies that Max is aware that staying could lead to a fight and is taking proactive steps to avoid it, which aligns with the general understanding of conflict prevention. However, without more context about the specific situation and the relationship between Max and Sam, it's difficult to definitively say whether this statement reflects common sense in all scenarios. \n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 2071, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max advises sam to go then max intends to to encourage sam to do well.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max advises Sam to go then Max intends to encourage Sam to do well\" suggests a positive intention behind Max's advice. Common sense dictates that when someone advises another person to take a particular action, it is generally with the intention of helping or benefiting them. Advising Sam to go implies that Max believes it would be in Sam's best interest, likely hoping it leads to a positive outcome, such as doing well. Therefore, the assumption that Max's advice is motivated by a desire to encourage Sam aligns with common sense understanding of interpersonal relationships and intentions.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}

Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max advises Sam to go then Sam feels grateful\" is not necessarily common sense, as it relies on specific assumptions about the relationship between Max and Sam, and Sam's attitude towards receiving advice. Gratitude is a personal and subjective feeling that can vary depending on the context and the individuals involved. It's possible that Sam might feel grateful for Max's advice, but it's also possible that Sam might feel indifferent, annoyed, or even resentful depending on the nature of the advice and their personal dynamics.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 2073, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max advises sam to go then sam feels positive.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If max advises sam to go then sam feels positive\" suggests that Sam trusts Max's advice and it has a positive influence on Sam's feelings. However, whether this statement is common sense or not depends on the nature of the relationship between Max and Sam, as well as the context of the advice. If Max is a trusted friend or mentor whose advice Sam values, then it is likely that Sam would feel positive if Max advises him to go. But if Max and Sam do not have a close relationship or if Max's advice is not reliable, Sam may not necessarily feel positive. Therefore, the statement cannot be considered common sense without additional context about the relationship and the situation.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 2074, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max advises sam to go then sam wants stays home from event.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max advises Sam to go then Sam wants stays home from event\" does not seem to follow common sense as it suggests a contradictory reaction from Sam. Generally, advice from someone is taken positively, and one would expect Sam to follow Max\u2019s advice to go to the event rather than staying home. Without additional context suggesting a strained relationship or a reason for Sam to act contrary to the advice, the statement appears illogical. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 2075, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max advises sam to go then sam wants to ask more questions.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max advises Sam to go then Sam wants to ask more questions\" suggests that Sam may have reservations or uncertainties about the decision to go, leading him to seek additional information or clarification. This indicates that Sam values Max's advice but still requires further details to make a well-informed decision. This behavior is typical when individuals are faced with decisions that have potential consequences or when they respect the opinion of the advisor but need more assurance. It is common for people to ask more questions to feel confident about their choices, especially when advised by someone they trust.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2076, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max advises sam to take then sam feels betrayed.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If max advises sam to take then sam feels betrayed\" does not necessarily align with common sense, as it lacks context and assumes a specific emotional reaction from Sam without considering the nature of the advice or the relationship between Max and Sam. Common sense would suggest that whether Sam feels betrayed would depend on factors such as the content of the advice, Sam's expectations, and the trust between them. Without additional information, it is not reasonable to assume that advice from Max would automatically lead to Sam feeling betrayed.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 2077, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max affects sam deeply then sam asks max to be in a relationship.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max affects Sam deeply then Sam asks Max to be in a relationship\" suggests a direct causality between emotional impact and a request for a romantic relationship. While strong feelings can certainly be a motivating factor for someone to pursue a relationship, it is not a given that deep emotional impact alone would lead someone to ask for a relationship. Relationships are complex and can be influenced by a variety of factors such as timing, mutual feelings, personal readiness, and external circumstances. It is not common sense to assume that deep emotional impact alone would necessarily lead to a relationship proposal. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 2078, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max affects sam's health then sam wants to stay away from max.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement implies that if Max has a negative impact on Sam's health, then Sam would naturally want to distance himself from Max to protect his well-being. It makes sense for someone to avoid situations or individuals that harm their health, whether physically, mentally, or emotionally. Prioritizing one's health and safety is a basic instinct and a rational decision. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2079, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max affects sam's interests then sam wants to help others too.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If max affects sam's interests then sam wants to help others too\" suggests a causal relationship between Max's influence on Sam's interests and Sam's desire to help others. However, this relationship is not necessarily logical or commonly understood, as individual motivations can be complex and influenced by a variety of factors. Additionally, the desire to help others might not be directly related to how someone else affects one's interests. Therefore, it is not necessarily common sense to assume that one would lead to the other without further context or explanation. \n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 2080, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max affords braces then max intends to to fix uneven teeth.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max affords braces then Max intends to fix uneven teeth\" implies a logical connection between being able to afford braces and the intention to fix uneven teeth. Typically, braces are used as a dental treatment to correct misaligned or uneven teeth. Therefore, if Max is investing in braces, it is reasonable to assume that his intention is to address an issue related to the alignment of his teeth. This assumption is based on the common understanding of the purpose of braces in dental care. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2081, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max affords sam opportunity then sam are demoted to a lower rank.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If max affords sam opportunity then sam are demoted to a lower rank\" does not align with common sense. Typically, providing someone with an opportunity is meant to support their growth, development, and potential advancement. Demoting someone to a lower rank as a result of being given an opportunity contradicts the general purpose of offering opportunities, which is to help individuals progress and succeed. Therefore, the statement lacks logical coherence in the context of common sense. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 2082, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max affords sam opportunity then sam feels friendly.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests a cause-and-effect relationship between Max providing opportunities to Sam and Sam feeling friendly as a result. It assumes that being given opportunities leads to positive feelings and friendliness. While it is possible that receiving opportunities can contribute to friendliness due to feelings of gratitude or appreciation, it is not a guaranteed outcome since Sam's feelings could be influenced by various other factors such as personal disposition, the nature of the opportunity, or external circumstances. Therefore, this statement cannot be considered common sense as it oversimplifies the complexity of human emotions and their triggers. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 2083, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max affords sam opportunity then sam feels grateful.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max affords Sam opportunity then Sam feels grateful\" suggests a cause-and-effect relationship where the provision of opportunity leads to a feeling of gratitude. It is common sense that when someone is given an opportunity, especially one that benefits them or improves their situation, they would feel grateful to the person who provided that opportunity. This is based on general human emotions and social norms where gratitude is a typical response to receiving help or advantages from others. However, the feeling of gratitude can also depend on other factors such as the nature of the opportunity, the relationship between Max and Sam, and Sam's personal values or circumstances.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2084, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max affords sam opportunity then sam feels thankful.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If max affords sam opportunity then sam feels thankful\" suggests a cause-and-effect relationship where providing an opportunity leads to a feeling of gratitude. In general, when someone receives an opportunity, especially one that benefits them or helps them grow, it is common for them to feel thankful towards the person who provided that opportunity. This is based on the typical human emotional response to receiving help or support. However, individual reactions can vary, and not everyone may feel thankful in every situation. Despite this, the general expectation aligns with the statement. \n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2085, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max affords sam opportunity then sam gains opportunity.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement is based on a cause-and-effect relationship where Max's action of affording an opportunity directly leads to Sam gaining that opportunity. In general, when one person provides or creates an opportunity for another, the recipient gains from that action. This is a logical and straightforward relationship, assuming there are no other complicating factors. Therefore, the statement aligns with common sense as it reflects a typical and expected outcome in such scenarios.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2086, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max affords sam pleasure then sam feels loved.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If max affords sam pleasure then sam feels loved\" suggests a causality between receiving pleasure from Max and feeling loved by Max. However, it's important to recognize that feeling loved is a complex emotional state that can be influenced by various factors, not just pleasure. Pleasure is a positive sensation that can contribute to feeling loved, but it's not the sole determinant. Additionally, the nature of the relationship between Max and Sam, the context in which the pleasure is afforded, and the intentions behind the actions also play critical roles in whether Sam truly feels loved.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 2087, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max affords sam protection then max intends to to help sam.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max affords Sam protection then Max intends to help Sam\" implies a causal relationship between Max's actions and his intentions. In general, if someone takes actions to protect another person, it is reasonable to infer that they have the intention to help that person. Protection is a form of help, and providing protection typically requires a deliberate action that aligns with the intent to benefit the protected individual. Therefore, it is common sense to assume that if Max is actively providing protection to Sam, Max intends to help Sam.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2088, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max affords sam protection then sam wants help.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If max affords sam protection then sam wants help\" does not necessarily align with common sense, as it implies a direct causation between receiving protection and wanting help, which may not always be the case. People may want help for various reasons, and receiving protection from someone else does not automatically mean that they want or need help. Additionally, individuals might seek protection as a preventative measure, even if they do not currently want or need help. The connection between protection and wanting help is not inherently logical or universally applicable.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 2089, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max affords sam the opportunity then sam becomes grateful to max.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If max affords sam the opportunity then sam becomes grateful to max\" suggests a cause-and-effect relationship where the act of providing an opportunity leads to gratitude. Gratitude is a common emotional response when someone receives help or a benefit from another person. It is a natural human tendency to feel appreciative when given a chance or assistance that could positively impact one's life or circumstances. However, individual differences in personality, past experiences, and the nature of the opportunity can influence whether gratitude is the resultant emotion. While it is generally expected that people feel grateful when given opportunities, it is not guaranteed in every case.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 2090, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max affords sam the opportunity then sam gets promoted.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max affords Sam the opportunity then Sam gets promoted\" suggests a cause-and-effect relationship where the opportunity given by Max directly leads to Sam's promotion. In a real-world scenario, promotions are typically based on a variety of factors including performance, skills, experience, and sometimes opportunities provided by superiors. However, the statement assumes that the opportunity alone granted by Max guarantees a promotion for Sam, which oversimplifies the complexity of promotion criteria in most professional settings. Therefore, the statement may not align with common sense as it overlooks other crucial factors that contribute to a promotion.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 2091, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max agrees and went then sam feels excited.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max agrees and went then Sam feels excited\" implies a cause-and-effect relationship between Max's actions and Sam's emotions. In this case, it suggests that Sam's excitement is contingent upon Max's agreement and presence. However, without additional context about the relationship between Max and Sam or the specific situation they are in, it's difficult to determine if this statement universally holds true as common sense. Emotions can be influenced by a variety of factors and the statement might not apply in every scenario. Therefore, it is not necessarily common sense. \n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 2092, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max agrees on anything then max intends to to take risks.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests a direct relationship between Max agreeing on something and his intention to take risks. However, this may not necessarily be accurate or common sense, as agreement on a subject does not inherently imply a willingness to take risks. Agreement could be based on various factors such as personal beliefs, knowledge, or external influences, and does not always correlate with risk-taking behavior. Therefore, assuming that agreement automatically leads to risk-taking intention could be an oversimplification and may not hold true in all cases.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 2093, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max agrees to a date then sam butterflies in their stomach.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests a causal relationship between Max agreeing to a date and Sam experiencing butterflies in their stomach, which indicates nervousness or excitement. This could be common sense if Sam has romantic feelings for Max and anticipates the date with excitement and nervousness. However, without knowing the specific context or the feelings involved, it is difficult to definitively say that this statement is common sense universally. It is subjective and depends on the emotions and relationship between Max and Sam.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 2094, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max agrees to a date then sam wants to get ready for the date.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max agrees to a date then Sam wants to get ready for the date\" implies a logical connection between Max agreeing to a date and Sam's readiness for the date. This assumes that Sam's desire to prepare for the date is contingent upon Max's agreement. However, without additional context about the relationship between Max and Sam or their individual motivations, it is difficult to determine if this is a common sense assumption. The statement could be interpreted in various ways depending on the personal dynamics and prior knowledge about the individuals involved. Therefore, it is not necessarily a common sense statement as it relies on subjective and situational factors. \n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 2095, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max agrees to disagree then max gets a chance to prove himself.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If max agrees to disagree then max gets a chance to prove himself\" suggests that by accepting differing opinions, Max opens up an opportunity to demonstrate his abilities or perspective. This can be seen as common sense because being open to disagreement often leads to further discussion, debate, or problem-solving scenarios where individuals can showcase their skills, knowledge, or reasoning. It encourages a healthy exchange of ideas and can lead to personal growth and proving one's point.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2096, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max agrees to go with sam then sam feels supportive.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests a causal relationship between Max's agreement to accompany Sam and Sam feeling supported. This could make sense if Max's presence provides emotional or practical support to Sam, making him feel more confident and reassured. However, without additional context about the nature of their relationship or the situation they are in, it's difficult to definitively say whether it's common sense. It largely depends on the individuals and circumstances involved.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 2097, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max agrees to go with sam then sam wants to spend time with x.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max agrees to go with Sam then Sam wants to spend time with X\" implies a conditional relationship where Sam's desire to spend time with X is contingent upon Max's agreement to accompany them. However, the statement does not provide any clarity on who X is or the nature of the relationship between Sam, Max, and X. Without additional context or information about the motivations and relationships of the individuals involved, it is difficult to determine if this statement aligns with common sense. Common sense would typically require a clearer connection or rationale behind why Max's agreement would influence Sam's desire to spend time with X.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 2098, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max agrees to take sam then sam gets helped by someone.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests a causal relationship between Max agreeing to take Sam and Sam receiving help from someone. It implies that Max's agreement to take Sam is a sufficient condition for Sam to receive help, which makes sense if Max is the one providing the help or if Max's agreement facilitates Sam receiving help from another source. This is a logical and reasonable assumption based on the context provided. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2099, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max agrees to the challenge then sam feels anxious too.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max agrees to the challenge then Sam feels anxious too\" is not necessarily common sense, as it relies on specific information about the emotional responses and relationship between Max and Sam. Without knowing more about their personalities, past experiences, or the nature of the challenge, it is not possible to predict that Sam would definitively feel anxious just because Max agrees to the challenge. The statement assumes a direct correlation between Max's decision and Sam's emotional state without providing context or evidence to support that assumption.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 2100, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max agrees to the date then sam feels excited.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max agrees to the date then Sam feels excited\" suggests a cause-and-effect relationship where Sam's excitement is contingent upon Max's agreement to the date. This implies that Sam has a positive anticipation or emotional investment in going on a date with Max. Such a reaction is typical when someone is looking forward to an event with a person they are interested in or care about. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that if Max, who might be someone significant to Sam, agrees to the date, it would naturally lead to Sam feeling excited. \n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2101, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max agrees to try it then sam cook up a different dish.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max agrees to try it then Sam cook up a different dish\" does not seem to follow common sense as it lacks a logical connection between the two clauses. Typically, if someone agrees to try a dish, the cook would not need to prepare a different one. The statement might make sense in a specific context where Max's agreement triggers the need for a different dish, but without additional information, the statement does not align with common sense reasoning. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 2102, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max agrees upon by the parties then sam feels happy.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If max agrees upon by the parties then sam feels happy\" seems to suggest a cause-and-effect relationship where Sam's happiness is contingent upon Max's agreement with the parties. This could be common sense if Sam's happiness is directly linked to Max's decisions or actions, and if the parties' agreement is important to Sam's goals or well-being. However, without additional context about the relationships and interests of Max, Sam, and the parties involved, it is not definitively common sense as it relies on specific circumstances not provided in the statement. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 2103, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max airs max's dirty laundry in public then max needs to need to say it.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that if Max reveals personal or private information about himself publicly, then he should be prepared to communicate or address it openly. This is a common sense approach, as taking responsibility for one's actions and being transparent about personal matters that have been made public is generally seen as a mature and accountable behavior. Therefore, if Max chooses to air his dirty laundry, it follows that he should be willing to discuss or explain it.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2104, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max allays sam's fears then sam feels better.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max allays Sam's fears then Sam feels better\" is based on the idea that alleviating someone's fears or concerns typically leads to an improvement in their emotional state. When fears are diminished or removed, it generally results in a sense of relief or comfort, which contributes to feeling better overall. Therefore, it makes sense that if Max successfully addresses and reduces Sam's fears, Sam would experience an improvement in mood or emotional well-being. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2105, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max allays sam's fears then sam feels calmer.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that if Max addresses and alleviates Sam's fears, Sam will feel calmer as a result. This is based on the understanding that fear can cause anxiety and distress, and addressing the root of fear can help reduce those feelings. Thus, if Sam's fears are allayed, it is logical to expect a reduction in anxiety, leading to a calmer emotional state. Therefore, the statement aligns with common sense as it follows the natural emotional response to fear being mitigated.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2106, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max allays sam's fears then sam feels safe.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max allays Sam's fears then Sam feels safe\" is based on a cause-and-effect relationship where allaying fears leads to a feeling of safety. Allaying someone's fears typically involves addressing or reducing the concerns that are causing fear, which logically would lead to a feeling of safety or security. If Sam's fears are successfully alleviated by Max, it follows that Sam would feel safer as a result.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2107, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max allays sam's fears then sam stops worrying.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max allays Sam's fears then Sam stops worrying\" is based on the idea that addressing and alleviating someone's fears or concerns can help reduce their anxiety or worry. This is a reasonable assumption, as addressing the root cause of someone's worry can help them feel more at ease and secure. Therefore, if Max is able to effectively allay Sam's fears, it makes sense that Sam would subsequently stop worrying, as the source of the worry has been addressed. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2108, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max allows sam access then max intends to to let someone in somewhere.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement implies that Max's decision to allow Sam access is an intentional act with the purpose of letting someone enter a specific location. This suggests that Max is aware of the implications of granting access and has a deliberate intention to facilitate entry. In everyday scenarios, when someone grants access to another person, it is typically with the intention of allowing that person to enter a particular place, whether it's a room, building, or gated area. Hence, the statement aligns with common understanding of the implications of granting access. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2109, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max allows sam access then max needs to determine sam's trustworthiness.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If max allows sam access then max needs to determine sam's trustworthiness\" implies that granting access comes with a responsibility to ensure that the access is not misused. It is important for Max to assess Sam's trustworthiness to mitigate potential risks and protect his own interests or assets. This assessment helps in making an informed decision about whether or not to grant access. Therefore, it can be considered as common sense to evaluate trustworthiness before allowing access to sensitive information, resources, or privileges.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2110, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max allows sam access then sam feels happy.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max allows Sam access then Sam feels happy\" implies a cause-and-effect relationship where Sam's happiness is contingent upon being granted access by Max. The validity of this statement depends on the context and the nature of the access being granted. If the access is to something Sam values or needs, it is reasonable to assume that being granted access would result in happiness. However, without specific details about what the access entails and why it is important to Sam, it is difficult to definitively say whether this is common sense. Common sense typically involves judgments or inferences that are widely accepted and understood by most people based on general life experiences. Therefore, more context is needed to determine if this statement aligns with common sense. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 2111, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max allows sam time then sam turns in their assignment.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max allows Sam time then Sam turns in their assignment\" is contingent upon a specific condition being met, that is, Max allowing Sam time. If this condition is met, then the result is that Sam turns in their assignment. This could be considered common sense if we assume that the only thing preventing Sam from turning in their assignment is the lack of time, and that Max has the authority or ability to grant this time. However, without additional context about the relationship between Max and Sam, the responsibilities of each, or other factors that might affect Sam turning in their assignment, it is difficult to definitively say this is common sense. \n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 2112, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max allows sam to keep the dog then max feels warm and fuzzy.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max allows Sam to keep the dog then Max feels warm and fuzzy\" suggests that Max experiences positive emotions as a result of allowing Sam to keep the dog. This could be due to a sense of generosity, kindness, or compassion associated with the act of allowing Sam to keep the dog. These feelings of warmth and fuzziness are commonly associated with doing something good or caring for others, which can be considered a common emotional response in such situations. Therefore, it is reasonable to say that the statement aligns with common human emotional responses to acts of kindness.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2113, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max allows sam to keep the dog then sam feels ecstatic.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests a causal relationship between Max allowing Sam to keep the dog and Sam's emotional response of feeling ecstatic. This is a reasonable assumption as many people feel joy and happiness when they are allowed to keep a pet they care about. Therefore, the statement aligns with a common understanding of human emotions in response to positive events involving pets.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2114, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max allows sam to keep the dog then sam feels jubilant.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max allows Sam to keep the dog then Sam feels jubilant\" suggests that Sam would feel great happiness or joy if allowed to keep the dog. This is a common emotional response when someone receives something they desire or care about. In this case, if Sam has a positive emotional attachment to the dog and wants to keep it, feeling jubilant upon being allowed to do so aligns with typical human emotions in response to fulfilling personal desires or forming bonds with pets. Therefore, the statement reflects a reasonable and understandable emotional outcome.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2115, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max allows sam to keep the dog then sam feels thankful.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests a causal relationship between Max allowing Sam to keep the dog and Sam's feeling of thankfulness. It is common for people to feel gratitude when someone does something favorable for them, such as allowing them to keep a pet they care about. Feeling thankful in such a situation is a natural emotional response as it reflects appreciation for the kind gesture. Therefore, it aligns with general human behavior and social norms of expressing gratitude when someone does something benevolent.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2116, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max almost hit sam then sam feels scared.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max almost hit Sam then Sam feels scared\" implies a cause-and-effect relationship where a potentially harmful or threatening action (Max almost hitting Sam) leads to an emotional response (Sam feeling scared). It is common sense that people generally feel scared or threatened when they perceive themselves to be in danger or at risk of harm. This emotional response is a natural survival mechanism. Therefore, it is common sense that Sam would feel scared in this situation.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2117, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max also asked sam then max intends to to know why something happened.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max also asked Sam, then Max intends to know why something happened\" suggests that Max's inquiry to Sam is motivated by a desire to understand a particular event or situation. This is a plausible assumption, as asking questions is a common way to seek information or clarification. However, the statement may not always hold true, as Max could have other reasons for asking Sam, such as confirming existing information or engaging in casual conversation. Therefore, it's not necessarily common sense to assume the specific intention of wanting to know why something happened just from the act of asking alone.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 2118, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max also decided then sam feels like someone agrees with them.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that if \"max\" makes a decision similar to Sam's, then Sam experiences a sense of agreement or validation from Max. This is a common psychological phenomenon where individuals feel supported or validated when others share similar opinions or decisions. It reflects the basic human need for social validation and belonging. Therefore, the statement aligns with general understanding of social behavior and human psychology.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2119, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max also practiced then sam did a good job too.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If max also practiced then sam did a good job too\" is not necessarily common sense, as it implies a causal or conditional relationship between Max's practice and Sam's performance without providing enough context to justify that connection. Common sense would require a clearer understanding of the relationship between Max and Sam's actions, such as whether they are teammates or if Sam is coaching Max. Without further information to establish a logical link between the two events, the statement cannot be considered common sense. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 2120, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max also set then sam wants to see how max did.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that if a person named Max participates in an activity or event, then another person named Sam is interested in seeing Max's performance or results. This statement may not necessarily be common sense, as it relies on specific information about the relationship or interest between Sam and Max. Without knowing the context or the nature of their relationship, it's not possible to determine if it's common sense for Sam to want to see how Max did. The statement could be true in certain situations where Sam has a vested interest in Max's performance, but it's not a universally applicable or self-evident truth.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 2121, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max also took sam then sam feels excited.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If max also took sam then sam feels excited\" implies a cause-and-effect relationship where Sam's excitement is contingent on being taken by Max. Without additional context, it is difficult to determine if this is a common sense statement, as it relies on specific knowledge about Sam's feelings and preferences regarding Max. In general, it is not common sense to assume someone's emotional response without knowing their individual circumstances and feelings towards the situation or person involved. \n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 2122, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max alters max's course then max intends to cause something good to happen.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If max alters max's course then max intends to cause something good to happen\" implies that any change in course by max is motivated by the intention to cause something positive. This assumes that max's actions and intentions are inherently aligned with a positive outcome. However, intentions can be subjective and complex, and altering a course does not necessarily mean that the intention is to cause something good. Sometimes changes in course might be motivated by other factors such as self-preservation, avoiding negative outcomes, or external pressures, which may not directly aim to cause something good.\n\nGiven these considerations, the statement cannot be universally accepted as common sense since it oversimplifies the complexity of intentions behind actions. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 2123, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max alters max's course then max needs to decide it needs to be changed.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If max alters max's course then max needs to decide it needs to be changed\" suggests that a decision to change something should be preceded by the recognition of the need for change. This aligns with the common-sense notion that deliberate actions, such as altering a course, should be based on thoughtful decisions and awareness of the necessity for adjustment. It emphasizes intentional and reasoned action rather than arbitrary or impulsive changes. Therefore, the statement implies a logical sequence of recognizing a need for change before implementing it. \n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2124, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max always beats then sam wants to stop losing.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that if \"Max\" consistently wins against \"Sam,\" then \"Sam\" may become discouraged and want to stop losing. This is a logical reaction as continuous defeat can lead to frustration and demotivation. People generally prefer to succeed or at least have a chance at success, and consistently losing can diminish the enjoyment and motivation to continue in any competitive scenario. Therefore, it makes sense that \"Sam\" would want to alter the situation to avoid further losses.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2125, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max always bragged then sam avoids them.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max always bragged then Sam avoids them\" implies a cause-and-effect relationship where Sam's avoidance is a response to Max's constant bragging. It is common sense that someone may choose to distance themselves from another person if they find their behavior, such as bragging, to be unpleasant or annoying. Therefore, the statement aligns with a typical social response to undesirable behavior. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2126, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max always forgot then sam feels annoyed.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If max always forgot then sam feels annoyed\" suggests a cause-and-effect relationship between Max's forgetfulness and Sam's annoyance. This could be considered common sense if we assume that Sam relies on Max to remember important things, and Max's consistent forgetfulness could naturally lead to Sam's frustration. However, without further context about the nature of their relationship or what Max is forgetting, it's difficult to definitively say whether this reaction is universally common sense.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 2127, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max always listened then sam feels loved.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests a causal relationship between Max's listening behavior and Sam's emotional state. It implies that Sam's feeling of being loved is contingent upon Max consistently paying attention and being receptive. While it is common for individuals to feel appreciated and valued when others actively listen to them, it is not universally true that this is the sole or primary determinant of feeling loved in all relationships. Relationships are complex and multi-dimensional, and feelings of love can be influenced by various factors beyond just listening.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 2128, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max always refused then sam should be politely.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If max always refused then sam should be politely\" does not make logical sense as it is grammatically incorrect and lacks a clear connection between Max's refusal and Sam's behavior. The use of the word \"politely\" is also incorrect as it is an adverb and does not fit grammatically in the sentence. Without a clear and coherent relationship between the actions of Max and the expected behavior of Sam, the statement cannot be considered common sense.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 2129, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max always stayed then sam wished he wouldn't always hang around.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If max always stayed then sam wished he wouldn't always hang around\" suggests that Sam prefers having personal space and time alone, and Max's constant presence may be bothersome or overwhelming for him. It's a common feeling for many people to desire solitude or a break from continuous social interaction, even with friends or loved ones. Therefore, the idea that Sam might wish Max wouldn't always hang around if he always stayed seems reasonable and aligns with common social dynamics.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2130, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max always wanted a puppy then max intends to to have someone to play with.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max always wanted a puppy then Max intends to have someone to play with\" suggests a specific intention behind Max's desire for a puppy. It assumes that the primary reason Max wants a puppy is for companionship and play. However, people might want puppies for various reasons such as protection, emotional support, or simply a love for animals. Without further information about Max's specific motivations, it is not common sense to assume that his intention is solely to have someone to play with. \n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 2131, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max amends sam act then sam feels glad for having been helped.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement implies that Sam will feel gratitude when Max helps him by amending an action, which is a natural human response to receiving assistance. It is common for people to feel glad or appreciative when someone helps them out, especially if the help rectifies a previous issue or mistake. This kind of emotional response fosters positive interpersonal relationships and encourages cooperative behavior.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2132, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max announces max's intention then max feels close to others.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests a causal relationship between announcing one's intentions and feeling close to others. Common sense may dictate that sharing personal thoughts or plans can lead to a sense of closeness as it involves vulnerability and trust, which are key components in building relationships. However, whether Max specifically feels close to others after announcing intentions can vary depending on the context, the nature of the intentions, and the individuals involved. It's not universally applicable, as different people may react differently in similar situations. Therefore, it cannot be considered common sense as it is not a widely accepted or self-evident truth applicable to all.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 2133, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max announces max's intention then sam feels connected.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If max announces max's intention then sam feels connected\" is not necessarily common sense as it relies on specific individual reactions and relationships that may not be universally applicable or predictable. The feeling of connectedness can vary greatly between different people and depends on many factors such as the nature of their relationship, the context of the announcement, and personal emotional responses. Therefore, it cannot be assumed as a general rule or common sense.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 2134, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max announces sam's decision then sam is engaged in conversation.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests a causal relationship between Max announcing Sam's decision and Sam being engaged in a conversation. It assumes that for Max to announce Sam's decision, Sam must have been involved in a conversation where a decision was made. However, it is possible for Max to announce Sam's decision without Sam currently being engaged in a conversation, such as if the decision was made earlier or communicated indirectly. Therefore, the statement does not necessarily hold true in all scenarios.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 2135, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max announces sam's intention then sam blushes.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If max announces sam's intention then sam blushes\" suggests a cause-and-effect relationship where Sam's blushing is a reaction to Max revealing his intentions. This could be common sense if we consider that Sam might feel embarrassed or shy about his intentions being shared publicly, which could naturally lead to blushing. However, whether this statement is common sense depends on the context and the nature of the intentions being announced. If the intentions are personal or sensitive, it is more likely to be common sense that Sam would blush. Without more context, it's difficult to definitively say this statement is always common sense.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 2136, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max announces the winners then max needs to get in front of an audience.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If max announces the winners then max needs to get in front of an audience\" implies that in order to make an announcement about winners, Max would need to be physically visible and audible to the audience he is addressing. Traditionally, announcements, especially in formal settings like awards ceremonies, require the announcer to be in front of the audience to communicate effectively and to engage with the attendees. Therefore, it aligns with common social and event norms that to make such announcements, one should be positioned where they can be seen and heard by the audience. However, with advancements in technology, announcements can also be made virtually or through recorded messages, which might not always require being physically in front of an audience. Nonetheless, the traditional and most direct method of making announcements still adheres to being physically present. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2137, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max announces the winners then sam gets awards.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max announces the winners then Sam gets awards\" does not necessarily follow common sense without additional context. It assumes a direct correlation between Max announcing winners and Sam receiving awards, which might not be the case unless Max's announcements are specifically and exclusively about awards Sam has won. Common sense would require understanding the relationship between Max's announcements and the process of Sam getting awards, which is not provided in the statement. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 2138, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max anoints sam with oil then sam feels part of the community.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max anoints Sam with oil then Sam feels part of the community\" suggests a cause and effect relationship between anointing with oil and feeling a sense of belonging. In many cultural or religious contexts, anointing with oil can be a symbolic act of inclusion or initiation into a community. However, whether or not Sam actually feels part of the community would depend on various factors including Sam's personal beliefs, the significance of the act in the specific community, and how the community interacts with Sam following the anointing. Therefore, it is not necessarily common sense to assume that anointing with oil alone would make Sam feel part of the community without considering these other factors. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 2139, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max answers sam questions then sam get's to share what they know.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement implies a scenario where Max responds to questions posed by Sam, and in return, Sam shares their knowledge. This suggests a reciprocal exchange of information and learning, which is a common practice in conversations and educational settings. Encouraging open communication and sharing of knowledge is generally seen as beneficial and logical. Therefore, the statement aligns with common sense as it promotes mutual understanding and learning through dialogue.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2140, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max answers sam's letter then sam has to open the correspondence.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max answers Sam's letter then Sam has to open the correspondence\" involves logical reasoning regarding the sequence of actions in communication. If Max is responding to a letter from Sam, it implies that Sam initially sent a letter to Max, which Max has already opened and read in order to respond. For Sam to be aware of Max's response and understand its contents, Sam would indeed need to physically open the correspondence containing Max's answer. Therefore, the statement aligns with the logical steps involved in letter-based communication.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2141, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max answers sam's phone then sam laughs at max because he or she notices that there is something funny going on on the other end of the line.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that Sam laughing at Max is due to something funny happening on the other end of the line when Max answers Sam's phone. This scenario is plausible, as it's possible for someone to find humor in an unexpected or amusing situation occurring during a phone call. However, it's not necessarily common sense that Sam would laugh specifically at Max, as the humor could be attributed to the situation itself rather than Max's actions. The connection between Max answering the phone and Sam laughing at Max isn't inherently logical or based on common sense, as it depends on the specific context of what is happening on the other end of the line.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 2142, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max answers the door then sam wants to come into thier neighbors house.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If max answers the door then sam wants to come into their neighbors house\" does not necessarily reflect a common sense understanding, as it implies a direct causal relationship between Max answering the door and Sam's desire to enter the house, which may not be logically or inherently connected. The desire of Sam to enter the house could be influenced by numerous other factors unrelated to who answers the door. Therefore, without further context or information indicating why Sam's desire is dependent on Max answering the door, the statement does not inherently align with common sense.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 2143, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max apologizes profusely then sam wants x to think about what they did.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement involves a conditional relationship between Max's apology and Sam's desire for X to reflect on their actions. It is not necessarily common sense because it assumes a specific and personal reaction from Sam based on Max's behavior, which may not universally apply to all situations or individuals. The assumption that an apology automatically leads to a desire for introspection in another party is not a broadly accepted or intuitive principle. \n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 2144, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max applies for a job then max needs to find a job vacancy in newspaper.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max applies for a job then Max needs to find a job vacancy in newspaper\" is based on the assumption that job vacancies are only available in newspapers. However, in the modern world, job vacancies are often advertised through various platforms such as online job portals, company websites, and social media, in addition to newspapers. While finding a job vacancy in a newspaper is one possible method, it is not the only or necessary method for applying for a job. Therefore, the statement is not universally applicable or reflective of current job search practices.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 2145, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max applies for a new job then max needs submit a resume or application.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max applies for a new job then Max needs to submit a resume or application\" reflects a general understanding of the job application process. In most cases, submitting a resume or application is a standard requirement for job seekers to provide potential employers with relevant information about their skills, experience, and qualifications. This helps employers assess whether the candidate is suitable for the position. Therefore, the statement aligns with common practices and expectations in the job market.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2146, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max applies for many jobs then sam feels obligated to respond.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max applies for many jobs then Sam feels obligated to respond\" does not necessarily follow common sense reasoning because there is no clear logical connection between Max applying for jobs and Sam feeling obligated to respond. The statement suggests a causal relationship without providing context or explanation as to why Sam would feel obligated. The sense of obligation that Sam experiences could be influenced by numerous factors such as personal or professional relationship with Max, or a sense of duty in a specific role such as a mentor or recruiter, but the statement alone does not provide enough information to establish this as a common sense conclusion. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 2147, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max applies to colleges then sam they make sure they learn.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If max applies to colleges then sam they make sure they learn\" is not clear and seems to have grammatical errors, making it difficult to determine what it is trying to convey. The relationship between Max applying to colleges and Sam making sure they learn is not logically connected based on the information given in the statement. Without further context or clarification, it is hard to determine if this is a common sense statement.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 2148, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max appreciates sam's effort then sam receives recognition.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max appreciates Sam's effort then Sam receives recognition\" implies a cause-and-effect relationship where appreciation leads directly to recognition. In a general sense, if someone's efforts are appreciated, it often leads to some form of recognition or acknowledgment, whether it be verbal praise, a reward, or another form of recognition. However, in reality, whether Sam receives recognition could depend on various factors such as the context, the visibility of the appreciation, and whether Max has the authority or means to give recognition. Thus, while the statement aligns with a common principle of appreciation leading to recognition, it is not guaranteed in every situation.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 2149, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max approaches max's crush then max feels incredibly anxious.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement describes a common emotional response that many people experience when approaching someone they have romantic feelings for. Feeling anxious in such situations is a natural reaction due to fear of rejection, nervousness about making a good impression, or uncertainty about the other person's feelings. This is a relatable experience for many individuals who have had crushes.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2150, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max argues a lot then max intends to his opinion to be recognized as valid.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max argues a lot then Max intends his opinion to be recognized as valid\" suggests a connection between arguing frequently and seeking validation for one's opinions. When someone argues, they are typically presenting and defending their viewpoint, which implies a desire for others to acknowledge and accept that viewpoint as legitimate or valid. Arguing a lot might indicate a stronger drive to have one's opinions recognized and validated by others. This is a common psychological and communication behavior, where the act of arguing is often associated with the intent to persuade and establish the validity of one\u2019s perspective.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2151, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max argues a lot then sam gets stressed.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max argues a lot then Sam gets stressed\" implies a cause-and-effect relationship where Max's arguing behavior leads to Sam experiencing stress. This could be common sense if we consider that being around frequent arguments can be emotionally taxing and stressful for many individuals. However, whether this statement is common sense or not also depends on the personalities and tolerance levels of the individuals involved. If Sam is particularly sensitive to conflict or has a close relationship with Max, it is more likely that Max's arguing would cause stress for Sam.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2152, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max arranges sam in order then sam they know what they are doing.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If max arranges sam in order then sam they know what they are doing\" is not very clear and lacks context, making it difficult to determine if it is common sense. The statement seems to suggest that if \"max\" organizes \"sam\" in a specific order, then \"sam\" is knowledgeable or competent in some way. However, without further information about who or what \"max\" and \"sam\" are and what is meant by \"arranging in order,\" it is hard to assess the validity or common sense of the statement. Additionally, the phrasing of the statement is somewhat confusing and grammatically incorrect, which further complicates understanding its meaning.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 2153, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max arranges sam interview then max needs to contact the person to do an interview with and make arrangements for them to attend.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement posits a logical sequence where Max, being responsible for arranging Sam's interview, must also take on the associated tasks of contacting the interviewer and organizing the logistical details for the interview to take place. This is a typical and reasonable expectation when someone is tasked with arranging an interview, as it involves coordination and communication to ensure the interview is successfully scheduled and attended by all necessary parties. It is an example of basic responsibility and planning in a professional or organizational context.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2154, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max arranges sam interview then sam starts job.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If max arranges sam interview then sam starts job\" does not necessarily align with common sense, as it implies a direct causation between arranging an interview and starting a job, which is not guaranteed. Arranging an interview is just one step in the process of obtaining a job. The outcome of the interview, performance, qualifications, and other candidates' competitiveness also play significant roles in whether Sam ultimately starts the job. Therefore, the statement oversimplifies the job acquisition process. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 2155, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max asks a friend to teach sam then sam feels thankful.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max asks a friend to teach Sam then Sam feels thankful\" is based on the assumption that Sam would appreciate the help received from a friend in learning something new or improving a skill. It is common for people to feel gratitude when someone takes time to assist them, especially if the help is requested by a friend on their behalf. However, individual reactions can vary, and some people might not feel thankful due to various personal reasons or circumstances.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2156, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max asks anyone then sam makes a friend.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max asks anyone then Sam makes a friend\" does not seem to follow common sense as there is no clear logical connection between Max asking someone a question and Sam making a friend. The outcome of Sam making a friend does not necessarily depend on Max's actions unless there is a specific context or additional information that ties the two events together. Without such context, the statement appears to be arbitrary and lacks a causal relationship.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 2157, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max asks if sam was okay then max feels relieved sam is okay.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement implies a cause-and-effect relationship where Max's relief is contingent upon receiving confirmation of Sam's well-being. In many cases, it is common for someone to feel relieved after verifying that a person they care about is okay, especially if they had concerns about their well-being. However, the statement suggests that Max's feeling of relief is automatic upon asking about Sam, regardless of the response or outcome, which is not necessarily common sense. Common sense would dictate that Max would feel relieved upon hearing positive news about Sam, not merely by the act of asking. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 2158, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max asks max's friends for help then max feels taken care of.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max asks Max's friends for help then Max feels taken care of\" suggests that Max perceives support and care when his friends respond to his request for help. Generally, friends are expected to provide support and care, which can lead to feelings of being taken care of. Therefore, this statement aligns with a common understanding of friendship dynamics. However, it's important to note that individual experiences and feelings can vary.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2159, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max asks max's sister then sam feels happy to be asked.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If max asks max's sister then sam feels happy to be asked\" involves a specific and possibly unique situation involving three individuals - Max, Max's sister, and Sam - and their emotional responses. It's difficult to determine common sense applicability without more context about their relationships and why Sam would be happy about Max asking his sister. Common sense typically involves widely held practical judgments and this scenario seems too personalized to be considered common sense. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 2160, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max asks sam advice then max feels like they have more ideas.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max asks Sam for advice, then Max feels like they have more ideas\" suggests that seeking advice from others can lead to a broader perspective and potentially generate new ideas. It is common sense that discussing problems or decisions with someone else can provide different viewpoints and insights that one might not have considered alone. This can lead to a feeling of having more ideas or options to consider. \nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2161, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max asks sam to be max's wife then max feels extremely happy.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max asks Sam to be Max's wife then Max feels extremely happy\" suggests that Max would feel extremely happy as a result of proposing to Sam, implying Max has positive feelings towards Sam. However, whether this statement is common sense or not depends on the context and the relationship between Max and Sam. If Max loves Sam and is confident in their relationship, it would be common sense to expect Max to feel happy after proposing. But if their relationship is not strong or if Max is unsure about the proposal, it would not necessarily be common sense to assume Max would feel extremely happy. Without additional context about Max and Sam's relationship, it's difficult to definitively say this statement is common sense.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 2162, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max asks sam to stop then sam feels ashamed for what they did.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max asks Sam to stop then Sam feels ashamed for what they did\" suggests that Sam would feel ashamed as a result of being asked to stop by Max. This assumption relies on the idea that Sam recognizes and agrees that their behavior was inappropriate, prompting feelings of shame. However, Sam's emotional response could vary depending on their self-awareness, their relationship with Max, and their understanding of the situation. It's not guaranteed that Sam would feel ashamed just because Max asked them to stop. People's emotions and reactions can be complex and are influenced by various factors. Therefore, it is not necessarily common sense to assume that Sam will feel ashamed solely based on Max's request.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 2163, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max asks sam's dad then sam feels satisfied for having helped.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If Max asks Sam's dad then Sam feels satisfied for having helped\" suggests a cause-and-effect relationship where Sam's satisfaction is contingent on Max asking Sam's dad for something. However, the statement lacks context about what Max is asking, why Sam's involvement leads to satisfaction, and how Sam's dad is related to the situation. Without more information, it's difficult to determine whether this scenario aligns with common sense, as common sense often relies on a clear and logical connection between actions and reactions.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 2164, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max asks to talk then sam feels heated from the confrontation.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests a causal relationship between Max asking to talk and Sam feeling heated from the confrontation. Without further context about the nature of their relationship or the topics they discuss, it's not possible to determine if this reaction is common. Different individuals have different emotional responses to confrontation, and it may not be universally true that Sam feels heated every time Max asks to talk. Therefore, assuming that this is a common sense reaction without additional context lacks sufficient evidence.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 2165, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max attracts sam's attention then sam feels curious about max.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests a causal relationship between attracting attention and feeling curious. It is common for someone to feel curious about a person or object that catches their attention, as curiosity is a natural response to encountering something unfamiliar or intriguing. This curiosity can drive individuals to seek more information or engage further with the source of their interest. Therefore, the statement aligns with general human behavior and psychological responses.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2166, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max begs sam's forgiveness then sam feels pitiful towards max.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If max begs sam's forgiveness then sam feels pitiful towards max\" is not necessarily common sense because feelings of pity are subjective and can vary from person to person. Begging for forgiveness may elicit different emotional responses such as anger, disappointment, or sympathy, depending on the context and the nature of the relationship between Max and Sam. It is not guaranteed that Sam will feel pitiful towards Max just because Max begs for forgiveness. Feelings are complex and can't be predetermined by a specific action.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 2167, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max boldly goes where no man has gone before then max intends to to achieve something new and wants to go beyond anyone has ever gone.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement implies that Max's intention to go where no one has gone before is driven by a desire to achieve something new and surpass previous limits. This aligns with common understanding, as venturing into uncharted territory typically involves seeking new experiences, discoveries, or achievements that go beyond established boundaries. Thus, the statement is logically coherent and aligns with general expectations of exploratory behavior.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2168, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max breaks wind then max wants attempt to minimize the odors that accompany flatulence fanning spraying air freshener opening windows.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that if Max breaks wind, he would naturally want to minimize the odors by taking actions such as fanning, spraying air freshener, or opening windows. This could be considered common sense as most people would likely want to reduce unpleasant smells in their immediate environment, particularly if they are the source, to maintain comfort and social etiquette. Therefore, the idea that someone would take measures to mitigate odors after passing gas aligns with typical behavior to maintain a pleasant atmosphere and avoid embarrassment.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2169, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max buys a new keyboard then sam wants to see if max wants to sign up for their mailing list even though they know max really does not want to.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement appears to be somewhat convoluted and not aligned with common sense. Typically, if someone knows another person's preferences or dislikes, they would not suggest or ask them to engage in activities they know are not wanted. In this case, if Sam knows that Max really does not want to sign up for the mailing list, it would not be sensible for Sam to ask Max to consider signing up. Therefore, the statement does not reflect a common sense approach to the situation. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 2170, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max buys a new wallet then max intends to to have an object to store his cash credit and debit cards ids and other miscellaneous items.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement implies that the purpose of buying a wallet is for storage of cash, credit and debit cards, IDs, and other miscellaneous items. This aligns with the common understanding and conventional use of a wallet. Since the statement reflects a typical and logical reason for purchasing a wallet, it can be considered common sense.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2171, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max calls the authorities then max feels like there is a problem that needs to be taken care of that has legal ramifications.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that Max's decision to call the authorities is motivated by his perception of a problem that requires legal intervention. This is a logical assumption, as people generally contact authorities, such as the police or legal services, when they believe a situation has legal implications or requires official oversight. Therefore, the statement aligns with common sense reasoning about why someone would involve law enforcement or similar entities. \n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2172, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max can tell sam that sam is being solipsist and insolent then max is authoritative.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that Max's ability to identify and confront Sam's behavior indicates authority. However, simply being able to call out someone's behavior does not necessarily equate to having authority. Authority typically involves a recognized or official power to make decisions and command others, which is not established by the mere act of telling someone they are being solipsistic and insolent. Therefore, the statement does not align with the general understanding of what it means to be authoritative.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 2173, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max carries out max's plans then max feels satisfied proud about acquired success social leverage believing in own abilities to achieve own set goals.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests a cause-and-effect relationship between carrying out one's plans and feeling satisfied and proud due to achieving success and social leverage, as well as believing in one's abilities. This idea aligns with common psychological understanding that achieving personal goals can lead to positive emotions and self-efficacy. It reflects the general notion that fulfillment and confidence often stem from personal accomplishments and the successful execution of one's intentions. Therefore, the statement taps into a widely recognized concept of how goal achievement can impact an individual's emotional and psychological state.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2174, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max carries out max's plans then max intends to satisfied proud about acquired success social leverage believing in own abilities to achieve own set goals.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement implies that if Max successfully carries out his plans, he will feel proud and satisfied because of the success and social leverage he gains, as well as a belief in his abilities to achieve his goals. This is a reasonable assumption as achieving one's goals often leads to a sense of accomplishment and increased self-confidence. Feeling proud and satisfied are common emotional responses to success, and gaining social leverage can enhance one's social standing and influence, which can further contribute to a sense of achievement. \n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2175, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max drops my phone then max feels happy about themselves because they wanted to hurt other person's feeling by dropping their phone.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement is not common sense because it suggests that Max would feel happy about hurting someone else's feelings by dropping their phone, which is not a typical or reasonable response. Most people would not feel happy about deliberately causing harm or distress to others. The statement also assumes that Max's intention behind dropping the phone was to hurt someone else's feelings, which may not necessarily be true. The overall reasoning and assumptions in the statement do not align with typical human behavior or emotions.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 2176, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max enhances sam's understanding then max needs to be able to translate knowledge into something sam can understand and relate too.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement implies that in order for Max to enhance Sam's understanding of a subject or concept, Max must possess the ability to communicate effectively and in a way that Sam can comprehend and connect with. This involves breaking down complex ideas into simpler terms, using relatable examples, and adapting the explanation to Sam's level of prior knowledge and learning style. This is a fundamental aspect of effective teaching and communication, as it ensures that the information being conveyed is accessible and meaningful to the learner. Therefore, the ability to translate knowledge in a way that the recipient can understand and relate to is crucial for enhancing understanding.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2177, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max examines sam closely then max may call a different medical expert to tend to sam if possible accident injuries are out of max's scope of ability.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement reflects a reasonable and responsible approach in a medical or emergency scenario. When examining a patient closely, a medical professional like Max can assess the extent and nature of injuries. If the injuries are beyond Max's expertise or ability to effectively treat, it is logical and prudent for him to consider calling a different medical expert who has the appropriate skills to manage the specific injuries. This ensures the patient, Sam, receives the best possible care tailored to his needs. \n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2178, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max falls to sam's knees then sam feels as if person is being forced into a situation that person does not want to stay in.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement implies that Max falling to Sam's knees causes Sam to feel a specific emotional response related to coercion. This is not a logical or common sense connection, as physical actions such as kneeling do not inherently convey coercion or unwillingness. The emotional response that Sam experiences would depend on the broader context of the situation, which is not provided in the statement. Therefore, the statement does not reflect a common sense understanding of cause and effect.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 2179, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max floors it then max needs to be in an area where accelerating quickly won't cause him to run into the person in front of him.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that Max should be cautious when accelerating quickly to avoid a collision with the person in front of him. This is a basic principle of safe driving or operating any vehicle, as it emphasizes the importance of maintaining a safe distance and being aware of one's surroundings to prevent accidents. It reflects common sense as it aligns with general safety guidelines and responsible behavior.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2180, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max gets sam's things together then max wants to not have anything in their space that belonged to sam to bring up memories and emotions.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement implies that Max is gathering Sam's belongings in order to remove them from their own space, suggesting that Max wants to avoid the emotional impact of being reminded of Sam. This reasoning makes sense as it is a common human behavior to remove items associated with someone in order to cope with emotions or move on from a relationship. Therefore, the statement aligns with a common understanding of human behavior in response to emotional distress.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2181, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max goes to the hardware store then max needs make sure they have enough money to purchase what they need from the hardware store.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement reflects a basic principle of being prepared financially before making a purchase. It is common sense to ensure that one has enough money before going to a store to buy something, in order to avoid the situation of not being able to afford the necessary items. This is a practical and logical consideration that applies to any shopping scenario, not just a hardware store.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2182, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max grows into such a gentleman sam wondered why sam was single then max is well mannered.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement lacks logical coherence and clarity, making it difficult to determine if it aligns with common sense. It appears to mix two different ideas: Max's behavior and Sam's relationship status. There isn't a clear, direct relationship between Max becoming a gentleman and Sam being single. Common sense would suggest that one person's manners do not directly influence another person's relationship status. Therefore, the statement does not follow a logical common sense reasoning.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 2183, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max has grown into such a gentleman sam wondered why sam was single then max is loner.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement lacks logical coherence and clarity, making it difficult to determine if it aligns with common sense. It appears to mix unrelated ideas about one person's gentlemanly growth and another person's relationship status, without a clear connection or causality between the two. Additionally, the conclusion that \"max is a loner\" does not logically follow from the initial premises provided in the statement.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 2184, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max hops in max's car then max groans in frustration after examining her pants and seeing that the contents of the bag have spilled onto her pants.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that Max groans in frustration due to the contents of a bag spilling onto her pants, which is a reasonable reaction to such an incident. However, the initial clause about \"hops in Max's car\" seems unrelated to the spilling of the bag's contents and her subsequent frustration. This lack of direct causality between the two events makes the statement somewhat confusing and not entirely aligned with common sense. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 2185, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max illustrates max's point then max wants to show his wife and kids how much fun they could have at disney world by showing them a video.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that Max wants to convince his family to visit Disney World by showing them a video, which is a practical way of illustrating the fun they could have. This is a common and effective method of persuasion, as visual aids can help make experiences more tangible and appealing. Therefore, the statement aligns with common sense reasoning.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2186, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max inspires sam with confidence then max is max inspires the children with confidence.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If max inspires sam with confidence then max is max inspires the children with confidence\" seems to lack logical consistency. Just because Max inspires confidence in one individual (Sam), it does not necessarily follow that he would inspire confidence in a group of individuals (the children). The ability to inspire confidence could vary depending on various factors such as the relationship between individuals, communication styles, and the individual needs of Sam versus the needs of the children.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 2187, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max is at the grocery store with sam's mom then max intends to to assist the mother with her grocery shopping to look like a good friend.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement makes an assumption about Max's intentions based solely on his presence at the grocery store with Sam's mom. It is possible that Max is there for other reasons, such as running his own errands or coincidentally being at the same place at the same time. Without additional information about Max's motivations or their relationship, it is not reasonable to conclude that Max's intention is solely to assist Sam's mom with her grocery shopping to appear as a good friend. Therefore, the statement cannot be considered common sense as it relies on an assumption without sufficient context. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 2188, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max is having trouble sleeping at night then max is subjecting their body to hazardous medications in an attempt to sleep potentially adding further injury to his physical wellbeing.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement assumes that if Max is having trouble sleeping, he is automatically using hazardous medications to address the issue, which may not necessarily be true. There could be various other methods Max might be employing to improve his sleep, such as lifestyle changes, natural remedies, or consulting a healthcare professional for safe treatment options. Additionally, the statement assumes that all medications taken for sleep are hazardous and will cause further injury to physical wellbeing, which is an overgeneralization. Medications can be safe and effective when used appropriately under medical guidance.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 2189, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max is having trouble sleeping at night then sam max's employer may have to hire a temp worker to fill their spot if max's is unable to come into work.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement reflects a logical course of action wherein an employer might need a temporary replacement if an employee, Max, is unable to perform their job duties due to health issues like trouble sleeping. It is common for employers to seek temporary help to maintain productivity and workflow when an employee is absent for any reason. Thus, the statement aligns with typical workplace practices.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2190, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max leaves the apartment then sam a would be thief who is casing the apartment complex sees max's leaving as an opportunity to rob their apartment.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement involves making an assumption about Sam's intentions and actions based solely on Max leaving the apartment, which is not necessarily a common sense conclusion. Common sense would suggest taking precautions to secure the apartment regardless of whether Max leaves or not, as anyone's departure could potentially be seen as an opportunity by a thief. However, the statement assumes a direct causal relationship between Max leaving and Sam deciding to rob the apartment, which is not a common sense assumption without additional context or evidence about Sam's intentions. Therefore, it is not common sense to assume that Max leaving directly leads to Sam robbing the apartment.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 2191, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max makes healthy choices then max needs be educated in this area so they can know what foods and exercises are good for them.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement posits that education is necessary for Max to make healthy choices regarding food and exercise. This makes sense as having knowledge about nutrition and physical activities can help individuals make informed decisions that benefit their overall health. Without understanding what constitutes a healthy diet or effective exercise, it can be challenging to make choices that truly promote well-being. Education provides the foundation for recognizing and adopting healthy habits. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2192, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max orders food then sam feels people who max ordered food from would feel grateful for an order being placed with their establishment.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement seems to suggest that when Max orders food, the people from whom he ordered would feel grateful for the business. This is a common assumption as businesses generally appreciate receiving orders which contribute to their revenue and success. However, the statement also assumes that all food establishments will always feel grateful, which might not be true in every case as some might be too busy or have other concerns.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 2193, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max paints my nails then max needs to locate a suitable area for nail painting preferably with a flat surface and good lighting.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement is common sense because when painting nails, having a flat surface provides stability for the items being used, such as nail polish bottles, and reduces the risk of spills and accidents. Good lighting is necessary to ensure that the nail polish is applied evenly and that the color is accurately represented. Both factors contribute to achieving a better result in nail painting.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2194, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max pisses in sam's cornflakes then max feels nervous don't know if it was right but pleased inside that sam's cornflakes are ruined.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement does not reflect common sense as it describes an unusual and inappropriate behavior, which is unlikely to happen in real life. Additionally, feeling pleased about ruining someone else's property is not a typical or reasonable emotional response. This scenario is illogical and does not align with generally accepted moral or social norms.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 2195, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max plays basketball with sam's friends then sam feels positive they got to play a game they like and got exercise alsol.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that Sam feels positive when Max plays basketball with Sam's friends because it involves playing a game they enjoy and getting exercise. This is a reasonable assumption, as engaging in a favorite activity and physical exercise are generally associated with positive feelings. However, without more context about Sam's personal feelings or preferences, it is difficult to definitively say that this is always the case. Nonetheless, the statement aligns with common understanding of enjoyment and exercise contributing to positive emotions. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2196, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max reads the bible then max by reading revelations they are able to secure a spot in heaven when they die thus physically when they die they will go to heaven.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement hinges on a specific religious belief that reading the Bible, specifically the book of Revelations, can secure a place in heaven. This is a theological perspective specific to certain interpretations of Christianity and may not be universally accepted as common sense, which typically refers to practical, everyday knowledge that is widely agreed upon regardless of religious or cultural background. Additionally, the concept of physically going to heaven after death is a spiritual belief that is not empirically verifiable.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 2197, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max rolls in the aisles then sam feels concern for the mental wellbeing of max after seeing them roll down the aisles of the grocery store.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that Sam feels concern for Max's mental wellbeing after observing unusual behavior, specifically rolling down the aisles of a grocery store. This reaction could be considered common sense, as it is natural for someone to feel concerned when witnessing behavior that deviates from social norms and could potentially indicate distress or a mental health issue. Being concerned for someone's wellbeing in such a scenario reflects empathy and consideration for others' conditions.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2198, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max satisfies max's curiosity then max intends to to educate and inform sam regarding something he she was excited about and wanted to know more.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement implies that if Max satisfies his own curiosity about a particular subject, he then intends to educate and inform Sam about that same subject. This suggests a causal relationship between Max's personal interest in learning and his intention to share that knowledge with Sam.\n\nIn general, it's common for people to want to share information or knowledge they are passionate about with others, especially if they know the other person is also interested. This sharing can help strengthen relationships, foster mutual understanding, and spread knowledge.\n\nHowever, the statement assumes that Max's intention to educate Sam is directly caused by his own curiosity, which might not always be the case. Max might have other reasons for educating Sam, or he might choose to keep the information to himself. The statement also assumes that Sam is interested in what Max has learned, which might not always be true.\n\nDespite these nuances, the basic idea that people often share knowledge they are excited about with others who are interested is a reasonable one.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2199, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max signs the real estate deed then sam wants to celebrate the successful closing and the commission they earned by going out for a nice dinner.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement implies that Sam is motivated to celebrate a successful real estate transaction, which includes the signing of the deed and the earning of a commission. It is common for individuals involved in successful business deals to want to celebrate their achievements, and going out for a nice dinner is a typical way to do so. Therefore, the statement reflects a natural inclination to commemorate a successful professional milestone.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2200, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max starts max's business then max intends to be financially independent proud about acquired power social leverage running own business.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that if Max starts his own business, his intentions are to achieve financial independence, feel proud of the power and social leverage he gains, and enjoy running his own business. It is common sense that someone starting a business would aim for financial independence and take pride in the autonomy and influence that come with entrepreneurship. These motives are typical for many business owners who seek to control their economic future and make an impact. Therefore, the statement aligns with general expectations and motivations for starting a business.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2201, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max sweeps sam off their feet then sam feels sam is likely thrilled that max is making the effort to sweep y off his her feet and having an emotional event as a result that is very positive.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that if Max makes a grand romantic gesture to sweep Sam off their feet, then Sam is likely to feel thrilled by the effort and experience positive emotions as a result. This is based on the common understanding that people generally appreciate and feel happy when someone puts in effort to make them feel special and loved. It is a reasonable assumption that such actions would lead to positive feelings unless there is prior negative context in the relationship that would lead to a different emotional response. Therefore, the statement aligns with common sense as it reflects typical human emotions and reactions in romantic scenarios.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2202, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max takes a wrong turn at albuquerque then max feels sad anxious dissapointed that they did not end up where they wanted to be.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that Max feels negative emotions as a result of taking a wrong turn and not reaching his desired destination. This is a reasonable and common reaction, as many people experience similar feelings when their plans go awry or they make mistakes. Feeling sad, anxious, or disappointed in such situations is a natural human response. Therefore, the statement aligns with common human experiences and emotions associated with making errors or facing unexpected outcomes.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2203, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max tells sam to meet then max wants to let sam know what to wear and or bring ie money for a restaurant warm clothes for a hockey game resume for an interview.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that when Max plans a meeting with Sam, he takes responsibility for communicating the necessary information to ensure Sam is prepared for the occasion, whether it be money, appropriate clothing, or materials like a resume. This reflects a common understanding of considerate and effective communication when organizing an event or meeting, ensuring all parties involved are adequately informed and prepared. Therefore, the statement aligns with the general expectations of social interactions and responsibilities. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2204, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max tries different things then max needs to tell their friends about the things they are going to try so they can get advise or suggestions.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that Max should communicate with friends about new endeavors to receive advice or suggestions. This can be seen as common sense because sharing plans with others can offer different perspectives, insights, and potential guidance that Max may not have considered alone. Friends can provide support, encouragement, and even cautionary advice that could be valuable in making informed decisions. Thus, involving friends in decision-making processes can be beneficial.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2205, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max waits a long time then max gets assurance eg via text call or face to face communication that the delay will not last much longer.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement implies that when Max experiences a long wait, receiving some form of assurance that the wait will end soon can provide comfort or relief. This aligns with a common human need for communication and information in situations of uncertainty. Being informed about the status of a delay can reduce anxiety and frustration, making the wait more bearable. This idea is generally understood and accepted as a considerate and effective way to manage expectations during delays. Therefore, the concept is rooted in common sense as it addresses a basic psychological need for reassurance in uncertain situations. \n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2206, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If max wants to go to school then max drives around the areas near the school they want to attend looking for an apartment that would be closeby.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement makes sense as it suggests that Max is being proactive and practical by searching for a convenient living arrangement close to the school.

{"id": 2207, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If opportunity doesn t knock build a door.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If opportunity doesn't knock, build a door\" suggests taking initiative and creating opportunities for oneself when they do not readily present themselves. This perspective emphasizes a proactive approach to achieving goals, rather than waiting passively for opportunities to arise. By building a \"door,\" or creating the means through which opportunities can come, one takes control of their own circumstances and increases their chances of success. This aligns with common sense as it promotes self-reliance and resourcefulness.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2208, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If people can telecommute during the pandemic there is no need to meet in person.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If people can telecommute during the pandemic there is no need to meet in person\" may not take into account several factors. While telecommuting provides a viable alternative to meeting in person and helps maintain social distancing, there are instances where in-person meetings may be necessary. Some situations require physical presence for hands-on tasks, sensitive discussions, or activities that rely on non-verbal communication, which can be challenging to convey through virtual means. Additionally, telecommuting technology may not be accessible to everyone, and not all job roles can be adapted to remote work.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 2209, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If people don't tie their shoes they will trip and fall when they start exercising.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If people don't tie their shoes they will trip and fall when they start exercising\" is based on the idea that untied shoelaces can easily get caught underfoot or entangled, leading to a loss of balance and potentially causing a person to trip and fall. This is a reasonable assumption as shoelaces are meant to keep shoes securely on the feet and prevent them from slipping off or moving around excessively during physical activities such as exercising. Therefore, it can be considered common sense to believe that not tying shoelaces increases the risk of tripping and falling during exercise. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2210, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If people leave a fast food store with a bag it would mean that they have cleaned up after themselves.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement, \"If people leave a fast food store with a bag it would mean that they have cleaned up after themselves,\" does not necessarily imply common sense. Leaving with a bag typically indicates that a person has purchased food and is taking it to-go. It doesn't necessarily mean they have cleaned up any mess they may have made while inside the store, such as disposing of trash or wiping down tables. The presence of a bag only signifies that the person has their order with them, not that they have taken responsibility for cleaning their dining area. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 2211, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If people leave a fast food store with a bag they didn't pay for their order.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If people leave a fast food store with a bag they didn't pay for their order\" suggests that walking out with a bag without paying is indicative of theft. However, there could be other explanations such as a mistake by the cashier, a pre-paid order, or a promotional giveaway. The statement assumes wrongdoing without considering these other possibilities. Therefore, it is not necessarily common sense to immediately conclude theft based solely on the observation of someone leaving with a bag. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 2212, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If people make more money by not working fewer people will work.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that if people can earn more money without working, they will have less incentive to work, as they can maintain or improve their standard of living without the need for labor. This assumption is based on the economic principle that individuals aim to maximize their utility, which includes both income and leisure. If they can achieve a higher income without sacrificing leisure (by not working), it is likely that they would choose not to work, or to work less. This is a common rationale in discussions about the effects of certain welfare programs or unconditional basic income on labor market participation.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2213, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If people teach boys to hurt they will grow up violent.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests a causal relationship between teaching boys aggressive behavior and their development into violent adults. Developmental psychology and social learning theory support the idea that children learn behaviors through observation and imitation of role models, such as parents or peers. If boys are consistently taught or exposed to violence, they may internalize these behaviors as acceptable ways to handle conflict or express emotions. This can potentially lead to increased aggression and violent behavior in adulthood.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that individual outcomes can vary widely due to a multitude of factors including genetics, environment, and personal experiences. Not all boys taught to hurt will necessarily grow up to be violent, and not all violent individuals were necessarily taught to be aggressive in childhood.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2214, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If people turn to look at you in the street you are not well dressed but either too stiff too tight or too fashionable.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that being well-dressed means blending in and not drawing unnecessary attention to oneself through clothing choices that are too extreme or unconventional. It implies that being well-dressed is about achieving a balance in one's attire, where the clothes fit well and are appropriate for the occasion without being overly attention-grabbing. This perspective aligns with a more conservative or traditional view of fashion, where the goal is to look polished and put-together without standing out too much. However, this may not hold true for everyone, as fashion can be a form of self-expression where standing out is sometimes the intention. Personal style varies, and what is considered well-dressed can be subjective and dependent on cultural and social contexts. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 2215, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If skill could be gained by watching every dog would become a butcher.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If skill could be gained by watching every dog would become a butcher\" suggests that simply observing an activity is not enough to develop a skill in that activity. It implies that active participation, practice, and experience are necessary to gain expertise. This idea aligns with common understanding of how skills are developed, as watching alone does not provide the hands-on experience and practice needed to master a task. Therefore, the statement reflects a common-sense perspective on skill acquisition. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2216, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If someone does not feel safe they should not wear a mask.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If someone does not feel safe they should not wear a mask\" may not be common sense, particularly in the context of public health and safety. Wearing a mask is primarily recommended to prevent the spread of infectious diseases, such as COVID-19, and to protect oneself and others. If someone does not feel safe wearing a mask, it might be due to discomfort or other personal reasons, but it does not negate the potential public health benefits of mask-wearing. Therefore, the decision to wear a mask should be based on scientific guidelines and recommendations rather than solely on personal feelings of safety. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 2217, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If someone does well in life they would usually look for ways to thank the people who helped them get where they are now.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement posits that individuals who achieve success are likely to express gratitude towards those who supported them along their journey. This idea aligns with the general understanding of human behavior and the principle of reciprocity, where people tend to return favors and acknowledge the support they have received. Gratitude is seen as a positive social and moral behavior that strengthens relationships and contributes to a supportive community. Additionally, expressing thanks can enhance one's own well-being and the well-being of others, creating a cycle of positivity. Therefore, it makes sense that successful individuals would feel compelled to show appreciation to those who contributed to their achievements.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2218, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If someone eats healthier they would also likely consider exercise sleep quality and other aspects of wellness.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that individuals who prioritize healthy eating are also likely to consider other aspects of wellness, such as exercise and sleep quality. This assumption is based on the idea that individuals who are conscious of one aspect of their health are likely to be aware of and proactive about other interconnected aspects. People who make the effort to eat healthily often do so with the goal of improving their overall well-being, which logically extends to other health-related behaviors. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that a focus on healthy eating could correlate with an interest in maintaining a holistic approach to health.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2219, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If someone has a fever they should try and get into a hot tub.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If someone has a fever they should try and get into a hot tub\" is not common sense. A fever is a sign that the body is fighting an infection and raising its core temperature to kill off pathogens. Getting into a hot tub would raise the body temperature even further, which could be dangerous and potentially lead to heat-related illnesses such as heat exhaustion or heat stroke. Instead, it is generally recommended to keep the body cool and hydrated during a fever. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 2220, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If someone keeps working a great deal it could be terrible for their health.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If someone keeps working a great deal it could be terrible for their health\" suggests that excessive work can lead to negative health outcomes. This is supported by numerous studies and research that show the correlation between overworking and various health issues such as stress, burnout, heart disease, and mental health disorders. The human body and mind require rest and recovery periods to function optimally, and a lack of balance between work and rest can disrupt physical and mental well-being. It is a commonly understood concept that maintaining a healthy work-life balance is crucial for overall health.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2221, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If someone outdraws you smile and walk away here s plenty of time to look tough when you re out of sight.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that it is wise to remain calm and composed in the face of a challenging or dangerous situation, rather than escalating it further. It emphasizes the importance of self-preservation and avoiding unnecessary conflict. By walking away and maintaining a composed demeanor when outdrawn, one can prevent the situation from worsening. The statement promotes the idea of prioritizing safety and defusing tension, which can be seen as practical and sensible advice. Therefore, the statement can be considered common sense as it encourages a thoughtful and cautious approach to handling difficult interactions. \n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2222, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If someone pours gas on your indoor fireplace while it is burning run.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "Pouring gasoline on a burning indoor fireplace is extremely dangerous as it can lead to a sudden and uncontrolled increase in flames, potentially causing a fire outbreak or explosion. This poses a serious risk to the safety of anyone nearby. Running away from the situation would be a reasonable and instinctive reaction to protect oneself from harm. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2223, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If someone scratches a lottery ticket they will check to see if they win any money.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If someone scratches a lottery ticket they will check to see if they win any money\" is based on the understanding that people generally purchase lottery tickets with the hope of winning a prize. Scratching the ticket reveals whether or not they have won, and it is a natural response for someone to check the results after making the effort to participate in the lottery. The primary motivation for buying a lottery ticket is the potential financial gain, so it follows that individuals would want to know the outcome. Therefore, it is common sense that someone would check to see if they have won any money after scratching a lottery ticket.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2224, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If someone wants a new look they are a fool to betray their own sense of style in favor of being trendy.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that an individual's sense of style is more valuable and authentic than simply following trends. It implies that one's personal style is an expression of their identity and should be maintained even when seeking a new look. Betraying one's own style in favor of trends might lead to a lack of authenticity and satisfaction. Therefore, maintaining one's sense of style while experimenting with new looks is considered more sensible than solely conforming to trends. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2225, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If someone were to see a bat they would take a picture of it.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If someone were to see a bat they would take a picture of it\" is not necessarily common sense because people's reactions to seeing a bat can vary greatly depending on the individual and the context. Some people may be frightened or uninterested and may not think to take a picture. Others might be curious or excited and choose to take a picture. Additionally, not everyone may have a camera or phone readily available to take a photo. Therefore, the assumption that everyone would take a picture upon seeing a bat is not universally applicable. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 2226, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If someone works well they can afford to spend the rest of the day not doing anything.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If someone works well they can afford to spend the rest of the day not doing anything\" suggests that efficient and productive work allows for leisure time afterward. While this can be true in some cases, it is not universally applicable. The ability to not do anything after working well depends on various factors including the nature of the job, individual responsibilities, and personal circumstances. For some, working well may enable them to take time off, while for others, ongoing commitments and responsibilities may still require attention regardless of how efficiently they have worked. Therefore, the statement cannot be considered common sense as it does not hold true for everyone. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 2227, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If someone's daughter is in high school or college sports they wouldn't like the idea of her sharing a bathroom or locker room and competing with a biological male.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement assumes discomfort and opposition to sharing facilities or competing with a biological male based solely on gender identity. It is important to consider that opinions on this matter can vary greatly among individuals. Some may prioritize inclusivity and equal treatment for all athletes, regardless of gender identity, while others might have concerns about privacy and fairness in competition. The idea of common sense can be subjective and influenced by personal beliefs, cultural norms, and societal values.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 2228, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If something is absurd in fact and reality it is absurd as an idea.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If something is absurd in fact and reality it is absurd as an idea\" suggests that the practical impossibility or irrationality of something in reality directly translates to its conceptual absurdity. However, ideas often exist in a realm of abstraction and possibility, separate from practical limitations. Many ideas that initially seem absurd in reality can lead to valuable innovations and breakthroughs when explored as concepts. For instance, the idea of human flight once seemed absurd in reality, but conceptualizing it led to the eventual invention of the airplane. Therefore, an idea's value or potential should not be dismissed solely based on its current feasibility in reality.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 2229, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If the company disregards signals that help it improve its customers will choose another brand.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that a company's success is linked to its responsiveness to customer feedback and signals for improvement. In a competitive market, customers have choices and tend to prefer brands that are attentive to their needs and continuously strive to enhance their products or services. Ignoring such feedback could lead to dissatisfaction and drive customers to switch to competitors who are more responsive. Therefore, it is logical and reasonable to believe that disregarding customer improvement signals can negatively impact customer loyalty and business success. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2230, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If the covid positivity rate is low mask mandates should be lifted.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If the covid positivity rate is low mask mandates should be lifted\" may initially seem logical, as lower positivity rates suggest reduced transmission of the virus. However, public health decisions depend on multiple factors, including vaccination rates, hospital capacity, new variants, and the potential for asymptomatic spread. Lifting mask mandates solely based on a low positivity rate might overlook these other crucial elements that contribute to controlling the pandemic. Therefore, it's essential to consider a comprehensive assessment of the public health situation rather than rely on a single metric. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 2231, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If the covid relief bill is packed with a lot of spending not related to covid people would toss it in the dumpster.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement implies that people would reject a covid relief bill if it includes unnecessary spending not directly related to addressing the pandemic. This is based on the assumption that people expect a covid relief bill to be focused solely on providing aid and resources to combat the effects of COVID-19. If the bill is seen as being used for unrelated expenditures, it could be perceived as inefficient or as an attempt to exploit the situation for other purposes, leading to public disapproval and rejection. Therefore, the statement reflects a common sense expectation that a covid relief bill should be focused and directly relevant to the issue it aims to address.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2232, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If the facts don`t fit the theory change the facts.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement, \"If the facts don't fit the theory, change the facts,\" suggests manipulating or ignoring empirical evidence to align with a preconceived theory. This approach contradicts the scientific method and principles of critical thinking, where theories and hypotheses should be developed or adjusted based on factual evidence. In research and decision-making, it's essential to base conclusions on accurate and reliable data rather than altering facts to fit a theory. Adhering to this principle ensures integrity and credibility in any analysis or investigation. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 2233, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If the gods listened to the prayers of men all humankind would quickly perish since they constantly pray for many evils to befall one another.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that humans often pray for negative outcomes for others, either out of malice, jealousy, or competition. If these prayers were to be answered by the gods, it would result in widespread suffering and chaos, ultimately leading to the rapid demise of humankind. This highlights the potential consequences of selfish or harmful desires and the importance of being mindful of our thoughts and intentions.\n\nGiven that the statement underscores a caution about the nature of human desires and the potential impact of their fulfillment, it reflects an understanding of human behavior that can be considered common sense. It serves as a reminder to be aware of the nature of our wishes and the effects they could have if realized.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2234, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If the lights owned by john is turned on then john would turn off the lights.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If the lights owned by John are turned on then John would turn off the lights\" is not common sense. Typically, if the lights are turned on, it implies that they are needed or being used, so there would be no immediate reason for John to turn them off. The statement contradicts the usual behavior of using lights when they are needed and turning them off when they are not. Therefore, it does not align with common sense to turn off the lights immediately after they have been turned on without any further context.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 2235, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If the snake has no poison or the man has no ego no one fears them.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If the snake has no poison or the man has no ego no one fears them\" draws a parallel between a snake's physical ability to harm (poison) and a man's psychological trait (ego) that could potentially lead to harm or conflict. The idea is that when these threatening aspects are absent, fear towards them diminishes. This makes sense as people generally fear snakes due to the potential physical danger of their venom and may fear certain individuals if their ego-driven actions could lead to negative outcomes. The statement taps into the general understanding of fear as a response to perceived threats, whether physical or psychological. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2236, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If there were no schools to take the children away from home part of the time the insane asylums would be filled with mothers.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "This statement suggests that schools provide a necessary break for mothers from the demands of childcare, which could otherwise lead to overwhelming stress and potential mental health issues. While it may seem exaggerated to claim that the absence of schools would lead to a significant increase in mothers in insane asylums, the underlying idea is that schools play a crucial role in supporting parents by allowing them some time for themselves and other responsibilities. It acknowledges the challenges of full-time parenting and the importance of having support systems in place to help manage those challenges. However, the statement could be seen as hyperbolic and not fully representative of all mothers' experiences. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 2237, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If there's a slight chance of getting the virus people should stay home.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If there's a slight chance of getting the virus people should stay home\" suggests a cautious approach to minimize the risk of virus transmission. It emphasizes public safety and individual responsibility to protect oneself and others. However, the practicality of the statement can depend on the specific context, such as the severity of the virus, availability of healthcare resources, and the impact on daily life and the economy. Staying home might be a prudent choice in situations where the virus poses a significant health risk and where healthcare systems are overwhelmed. On the other hand, it might not be feasible or necessary in cases where the virus has a low transmission rate or mild effects, and where preventive measures like vaccination and wearing masks are in place. Therefore, whether or not this statement is considered common sense can vary based on the particular circumstances.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 2238, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If two people vaccinated against a disease get together the risk of disease transmission is extremely low.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement is based on the understanding that vaccines are designed to build immunity against specific diseases, and when people are vaccinated, they are less likely to contract or transmit the disease. When two vaccinated individuals come together, both have a significantly reduced risk of carrying or spreading the disease, further lowering the probability of transmission between them. This aligns with the general principles of how vaccines work in creating herd immunity and reducing the spread of infectious diseases.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2239, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If we are on a road trip then we should be careful to start the trip with a well maintained vehicle.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement is based on the idea that a well-maintained vehicle is less likely to break down or have mechanical issues during a road trip, which could lead to delays, safety hazards, or other complications. Ensuring the vehicle is in good condition before starting a trip is a precautionary measure to enhance safety and efficiency. As this is a practical and reasonable approach to minimize risks associated with long drives, the statement reflects common sense. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2240, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If we are taking out the garbage then we feel helpful.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If we are taking out the garbage then we feel helpful\" is contingent upon individual feelings and perceptions. While taking out the garbage is a helpful and responsible task, whether or not someone actually feels helpful while doing it can vary. Some might see it as a simple chore and not derive any particular feeling of helpfulness, while others might feel a sense of contribution to their household or community and therefore feel helpful. Therefore, the statement doesn't necessarily hold as a universal truth or common sense, as the feeling of being helpful is subjective. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 2241, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If we ask for someone else to explain things they will think about it against their own justification.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that when we ask someone to explain something, they will process the request and respond based on their own reasoning and perspective. This is a common psychological and communication principle, as individuals naturally interpret and respond to inquiries through the lens of their own experiences, beliefs, and biases. Asking for an explanation inherently involves the other person's subjective understanding and justification of the topic at hand.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2242, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If we buy a new chair they will immediately give it away.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If we buy a new chair they will immediately give it away\" does not seem to be common sense because it lacks context or a logical reason as to why a new chair would be given away immediately after purchase. Common sense would suggest that if someone buys a new chair, they intend to use it rather than give it away. Without further information or explanation about specific circumstances that would make this action reasonable, the statement does not align with typical reasoning or practical judgment. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 2243, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If we don't sleep well then we might hide under our beds.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If we don't sleep well then we might hide under our beds\" does not seem to align with common sense. Generally, not sleeping well might lead to feelings of tiredness, irritability, or difficulty concentrating, but it does not typically cause people to hide under their beds. Hiding under the bed is an unusual behavior that is not commonly associated with lack of sleep. Instead, it might be related to fear or seeking a sense of security, which are not direct consequences of poor sleep. \n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 2244, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If we don`t change direction soon we`ll end up where we`re going.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If we don't change direction soon, we'll end up where we're going\" suggests that continuing on the same path or trajectory will lead to a predictable outcome. It emphasizes the importance of making adjustments or changes if the current path is not desirable. The statement is a reminder that actions have consequences and that being proactive in making changes can alter the outcome. This can be considered common sense, as it is a basic understanding that sticking to the same course of action will lead to the same result. Therefore, if a different result is desired, a change in direction is necessary.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2245, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If we feel a bit cold we would still feel alright.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If we feel a bit cold we would still feel alright\" is based on the idea that feeling slightly cold is a minor discomfort that most people can tolerate without significant distress. This tolerance can vary depending on individual preferences, health conditions, and environmental factors. However, in general, feeling a bit cold is not typically associated with severe discomfort or harm, and people can often adjust by adding layers of clothing or increasing physical activity to generate warmth.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2246, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If we feel a little cold we might want to eat some ice cream.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If we feel a little cold we might want to eat some ice cream\" does not align with common sense, as it is typical for people to seek warmth when feeling cold, rather than consuming something cold like ice cream. Eating ice cream might be more associated with wanting to cool down when feeling hot, rather than warming up when feeling cold. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 2247, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If we feel a little warm we would not shiver.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "Shivering is a physiological response that occurs when the body is cold and works to generate heat and raise body temperature. If we feel a little warm, it indicates that our body temperature is already elevated, and therefore, there would be no need for the body to initiate shivering to generate additional heat. This aligns with the basic understanding of how the body regulates temperature. \n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2248, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If we fight someone else we should punch them on the body.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests using physical violence as a means to handle conflicts, which is generally not a recommended or ethical approach. Resolving conflicts through communication, negotiation, or mediation is a more constructive and peaceful method. Resorting to violence can lead to further aggression, legal consequences, and physical harm to all parties involved. Encouraging physical violence contradicts the principles of promoting a safe and respectful society. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 2249, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If we get on a crowded train they will immediately get off it.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If we get on a crowded train they will immediately get off it\" does not seem to be based on common sense. Common sense would suggest that people's decisions to get off a train depend on their destination or discomfort, not merely because new passengers have boarded. The statement lacks a logical basis or context that explains why \"they\" would get off the train immediately upon others boarding. Therefore, it does not align with common sense assumptions about typical behavior in public transportation.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 2250, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If we get on an empty train we would stand instead of sit.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If we get on an empty train we would stand instead of sit\" does not align with common sense. Typically, when a train is empty and there are plenty of seats available, people would choose to sit for comfort rather than stand, especially if the journey is long. Standing when there are available seats would be less comfortable and less practical. Therefore, it does not make sense to choose to stand in an empty train when seating is an option. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 2251, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If we keep doing what we're doing we're going to keep getting what we're getting.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If we keep doing what we're doing we're going to keep getting what we're getting\" is rooted in the idea that actions lead to consistent outcomes if the conditions remain the same. This reflects a basic understanding of cause and effect, where similar causes under similar circumstances generally lead to similar effects. In other words, without any change in behavior or approach, the results are likely to be the same. This concept is applicable in various aspects of life, including personal habits, work performance, and relationships. Therefore, it is a statement that aligns with common sense because it emphasizes the importance of change for different outcomes. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2252, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If we leave the building we would neglect to look both ways before crossing the street.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If we leave the building we would neglect to look both ways before crossing the street\" is not necessarily common sense. Common sense would suggest that leaving a building does not inherently lead to neglecting safety precautions such as looking both ways before crossing the street. The statement implies a cause-and-effect relationship that is not logically supported by the action of leaving a building alone. Individuals can choose to be cautious and attentive regardless of their location. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 2253, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If we leave the living room we would turn off the lights and the television.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If we leave the living room we would turn off the lights and the television\" reflects the practice of conserving energy and reducing unnecessary power consumption. It is generally considered common sense to turn off electrical appliances and lights when they are not in use, in order to save energy and reduce electricity bills. This practice is also environmentally friendly as it helps to reduce carbon emissions associated with electricity generation. Therefore, the statement aligns with the principles of energy conservation and environmental responsibility.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2254, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If we pay our debts then we are better able to ask for a loan.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If we pay our debts then we are better able to ask for a loan\" reflects the idea that a history of responsible debt repayment can improve one's creditworthiness. When individuals or businesses consistently pay off their debts, they demonstrate financial reliability and discipline. Lenders typically consider these factors when assessing the risk associated with a loan application. A positive repayment history can lead to a better credit score, which in turn increases the likelihood of loan approval and potentially more favorable loan terms. Therefore, the statement is rooted in the principles of credit evaluation and risk management commonly used in the financial industry.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2255, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If we pay someone else's debts they would feel relieved and relaxed.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "Paying off someone else's debts can alleviate the financial burden and stress they may be experiencing, which can lead to feelings of relief and relaxation. Debt can be a significant source of worry and anxiety, and eliminating that debt can help improve the individual's mental and emotional well-being. Therefore, it is reasonable to say that the person whose debts are paid would likely feel relieved and relaxed.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2256, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If we play rugby we are going to get hit.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If we play rugby we are going to get hit\" is based on the nature of the sport itself. Rugby is a full-contact sport that involves tackling, rucking, and other physical interactions between players. It is widely understood and accepted that physical contact and collisions are inherent aspects of the game. Therefore, players can expect that they will get hit during the course of play. Considering this information, the statement aligns with the common characteristics of rugby.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2257, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If we want to keep our representative working for us we cant be complacent.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If we want to keep our representative working for us we can't be complacent\" suggests that active participation and engagement are necessary to ensure that elected officials continue to represent the interests of their constituents. This idea aligns with the principles of representative democracy, where the power of elected officials is derived from the will and involvement of the people they represent. By staying informed, voicing opinions, and holding representatives accountable, citizens can influence their representatives' actions and decisions. If people become complacent and disengaged, representatives may not feel the pressure to address the needs and concerns of their constituents effectively.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2258, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If we work ourself to the bone we can rest awhile to regain energy.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If we work ourselves to the bone we can rest awhile to regain energy\" suggests that intense work should be followed by a period of rest to recover energy. This aligns with the general understanding that the body and mind need rest after exertion to recuperate and maintain productivity and health. Overworking without adequate rest can lead to burnout, decreased efficiency, and health problems. Therefore, taking breaks after intense work periods is a sensible approach to maintaining overall well-being and sustaining long-term productivity. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2259, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If we work the night shift we will sleep during the day so that we can be awake for work.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement, \"If we work the night shift we will sleep during the day so that we can be awake for work,\" is based on the logical assumption that individuals need to adjust their sleep schedule to accommodate their work hours. Working at night requires being alert and awake when most people are typically asleep. In order to function optimally and maintain overall health, it is necessary to get adequate rest, which in the case of night shift workers, would mean sleeping during the day. This adjustment is essential for maintaining a healthy work-life balance and ensuring safety and productivity at work. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2260, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If we work the night shift we would be able to complete it successfully.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If we work the night shift we would be able to complete it successfully\" suggests that working the night shift may provide certain advantages or conditions that are conducive to completing a task successfully. This could be due to factors such as fewer distractions, cooler temperatures, or a quieter work environment. However, whether this statement is common sense depends on the specific context and nature of the task. For some tasks, working the night shift might indeed be beneficial, while for others it might not make a difference or could even be detrimental. Without additional information about the task and the work environment, it is difficult to definitively say whether this statement is common sense. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 2261, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If we work together we can elect new leaders.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If we work together we can elect new leaders\" speaks to the power of collective action and unity in achieving political change. In democratic systems, collaboration and mobilization of groups can significantly impact election outcomes by rallying support for new leaders who represent their interests and values. History has shown numerous examples where united efforts have led to the election of new leaders who bring change and reform. Therefore, the statement is grounded in a practical understanding of how democratic processes work.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2262, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If you allow men to use you for your own purposes they will use you for theirs.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that if one allows themselves to be manipulated or taken advantage of by others for personal gain, those same individuals will likely exploit them for their own benefit in return. This can be seen as a cautionary reminder about the potential consequences of using others or allowing oneself to be used. It emphasizes the importance of maintaining healthy and equitable relationships, where neither party seeks to manipulate the other for selfish reasons. This perspective aligns with common sense, as it encourages individuals to consider the long-term implications of their actions and relationships.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2263, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If you are afraid of being lonely don`t try to be right.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If you are afraid of being lonely don't try to be right\" suggests that insisting on being right in disagreements or conflicts can alienate others and lead to loneliness. This idea is based on the notion that interpersonal relationships often require compromise, understanding, and flexibility, rather than stubbornly holding onto one's own views at the expense of others' feelings or perspectives. Being overly concerned with being right can create distance and strain relationships, potentially leading to isolation.\n\nHowever, this statement may not always hold true as there are situations where standing up for what is right is important, even if it risks loneliness. It ultimately depends on the context and the values at stake in each specific situation.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 2264, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If you are afraid of loneliness don`t marry.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If you are afraid of loneliness, don't marry\" may seem counterintuitive at first because marriage is often associated with companionship and partnership. However, marriage also involves a significant amount of personal responsibility, compromise, and sometimes solitude in terms of individual growth and personal space. If someone is afraid of loneliness, they might have underlying issues related to emotional dependence or unrealistic expectations of constant companionship from their partner. These issues could potentially strain a marriage if the person relies solely on their spouse for emotional fulfillment and fears any moments of solitude within the relationship. Therefore, it is important to have a healthy relationship with oneself and be comfortable with occasional solitude before entering into a marriage. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2265, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If you are bitten by a cat you need to disinfect the wound right away as you could get an infection.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement is based on the fact that cat bites can introduce bacteria and other infectious agents into the wound, which can lead to infection if not properly cleaned and disinfected. Cats' mouths contain a variety of bacteria, and their sharp teeth can create deep puncture wounds that are more prone to infection. Disinfecting the wound right away helps to reduce the risk of infection and promotes healing. Therefore, it is sensible to take immediate action to clean and disinfect a cat bite. \n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2266, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If you are lucky enough to have lived in paris as a young man then wherever you go for the rest of your life it stays with you for paris is a moveable feast.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that living in Paris as a young man leaves a lasting impact on a person's life, implying that the experiences and memories gained in Paris are so enriching and influential that they continue to shape and enhance one's perspective and life, no matter where they go afterward. This idea can resonate with many who believe that certain formative experiences or environments can have a profound and lasting effect on an individual. However, whether or not this statement is considered common sense can vary from person to person, as it is subjective and depends on personal values and experiences. For someone who values travel and cultural experiences, this statement might seem like common sense. For others who prioritize different life experiences, it may not resonate as much.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 2267, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If you burn wood you make smoke.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If you burn wood you make smoke\" is based on the observable phenomenon that burning wood produces smoke as a result of combustion. When wood is burned, it undergoes a chemical reaction with oxygen, releasing gases, particles, and other substances in the form of smoke. This is a well-known and widely understood process that occurs whenever wood is burned in the presence of oxygen. Therefore, it aligns with common knowledge and experiences that most people have observed or can easily understand.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2268, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If you can't travel pick up a book about a country and use your imagination.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If you can't travel pick up a book about a country and use your imagination\" is grounded in common sense because it offers a practical alternative to physically traveling. Reading about a country can provide insights and knowledge about its culture, history, and environment, which can mentally transport a reader to that place. This allows individuals to experience and learn about different parts of the world without physically being there, making it an accessible and affordable option for exploration. Therefore, the statement is based on the sensible idea of using available resources, such as books, to broaden one's understanding of the world. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2269, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If you chase down everything then you won't finish anything.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If you chase down everything then you won't finish anything\" suggests that spreading oneself too thin by attempting to pursue too many tasks or goals simultaneously can lead to a lack of focus and an inability to complete any of them effectively. This idea aligns with common sense as it is generally understood that concentrating efforts and prioritizing tasks leads to better productivity and more successful outcomes. Overextending oneself can result in unfinished projects and decreased efficiency. Therefore, the statement reflects a practical understanding of time and resource management.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2270, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If you create an act you create a habit if you create a habit you create a character if you create a character you create a destiny.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement implies that small actions can lead to larger consequences, shaping who a person becomes and ultimately their future. It suggests that habits are formed through repeated actions and these habits contribute to the development of a person's character. A person's character, in turn, influences their destiny. This idea aligns with common psychological and philosophical beliefs about the influence of behavior on personal development. It is a reminder that even small actions can have significant long-term effects, which is a principle that many people recognize as reasonable.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2271, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If you dislike a person it doesn't mean you hate them.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "Disliking and hating are two different emotions. Disliking someone means having a mild negative feeling toward them, perhaps due to a difference in opinions or personality traits. It does not necessarily involve strong feelings of animosity or ill-will. On the other hand, hating someone involves a much stronger and deeper negative feeling, often associated with intense hostility and aversion. Therefore, it is reasonable to acknowledge that disliking someone does not inherently escalate to the level of hatred. This distinction between dislike and hate is an important aspect of understanding the complexity of human emotions.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2272, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If you do not spare a day to fix the door to your room you will waste three years searching for your money but you will never find it.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement appears to be metaphorical or allegorical rather than rooted in common sense. It suggests a cause-and-effect relationship between fixing a door and finding money that is not logically or practically supported in a literal sense. The idea of spending exactly three years searching for money with the outcome of never finding it due to not fixing a door lacks a clear, rational connection. It seems more like a cautionary or exaggerated tale to emphasize the importance of addressing small problems before they lead to larger issues. However, the specific scenario described does not align with practical common sense. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 2273, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If you don t know where you are any road will do.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If you don't know where you are, any road will do\" implies that without a clear destination or goal in mind, any path or direction one takes is equally valid. This makes sense in the context that without a specific endpoint, one cannot make an informed decision about the best route to take. In other words, in the absence of a clear objective, any choice made is arbitrary and lacks a basis for preference. This statement emphasizes the importance of having a clear understanding of one's current position and desired outcome in order to make meaningful and effective decisions.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2274, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If you don't drink for three days you will die.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"If you don't drink for three days you will die\" is based on the idea that water is essential for survival. The human body requires water to maintain vital functions, such as regulating temperature, transporting nutrients and oxygen, and removing waste. While individual tolerance can vary, it is generally understood that a person can only survive a few days without water, depending on factors such as temperature and physical activity.\n\nHowever, whether or not this statement is true depends on the specific circumstances and the health of the individual. Some people might be able to survive slightly longer than three days without water, while others might succumb more quickly. Therefore, while the statement reflects a general understanding of the importance of hydration for survival, it is not an absolute rule that applies in all cases.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 2275, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If you don`t get what you want it`s a sign either that you did not seriously want it or that you tried to bargain over the price.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement implies that the only reasons for not getting what you want are a lack of genuine desire or an unwillingness to pay the necessary price. However, this overlooks various external factors that could prevent someone from achieving their goals, such as limited resources, external competition, or unforeseen circumstances. Additionally, it assumes that all outcomes are within an individual's control, which is not always the case. It also doesn't consider the possibility of conflicting desires or priorities that might lead someone to choose a different path. Therefore, the statement oversimplifies the complexities involved in achieving goals and does not account for the full range of reasons why someone might not get what they want.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 2276, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"If you eat 3 cheeseburgers after working out you need to work out more to work on those cheeseburgers.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement is based on the idea that consuming high-calorie foods like cheeseburgers can offset the benefits of a workout, as the calories gained can exceed the calories burned during exercise. Eating three cheeseburgers, which are typically high in fats and calories, would contribute a significant amount of calories that might require additional exercise to burn off in order to maintain caloric balance or avoid weight gain.

Instead, they serve more as symbols or representatives for broader social, economic, or political forces at play. This perspective aligns with the idea that history is shaped by complex factors and that reducing it to the actions of a few individuals oversimplifies the reality.\n\nThis viewpoint is supported by historical materialism, which argues that larger structures and class struggles drive historical change, rather than individual actions.

For some, the pursuit of evidence and proof through reason and observation is considered a valid and independent pathway to understanding the existence of a higher power, regardless of divine intervention.\n\nSince the acceptance of the statement depends on specific theological and philosophical assumptions about God's nature and the means of acquiring knowledge, it may not be universally regarded as common sense, which typically implies a broadly accepted and self-evident truth.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 2400, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"It is impossible to travel faster than the speed of light and certainly not desirable as one`s hat keeps blowing off.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement is not common sense because it mixes scientific fact with humor. The first part of the statement, \"It is impossible to travel faster than the speed of light,\" is based on the current understanding of physics according to Einstein's theory of relativity. The second part, \"and certainly not desirable as one's hat keeps blowing off,\" is a humorous addition that does not have a scientific basis. It is meant to be amusing rather than factual. Therefore, the statement as a whole cannot be considered common sense since it blends established scientific knowledge with a lighthearted joke.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 2401, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"It is inconceivable how much wit it requires to avoid being ridiculous.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement implies that it takes a significant amount of cleverness and awareness to avoid appearing foolish or absurd in various situations. This suggests that being naturally witty or intelligent can help navigate social interactions and prevent embarrassment. It's a reflection on the fine line between being witty and being ridiculous, and how easily one can cross into the latter without careful consideration. It also highlights the importance of self-awareness and understanding social cues to maintain a favorable impression. Given that this insight isn't immediately obvious to everyone and requires some reflection on social dynamics and human behavior, it may not be considered common sense, which typically involves more straightforward, widely acknowledged knowledge.\n\nSo the answer is no."}

{"id": 2403, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"It is most unwise for people in love to marry.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"It is most unwise for people in love to marry\" seems to suggest that marrying purely based on romantic love is impractical or risky. While it is true that successful marriages require more than just love, such as mutual respect, trust, and shared values, it is not necessarily \"unwise\" for people in love to marry. Love can be a strong foundation that motivates partners to work through challenges and grow together. Furthermore, marrying someone you love can enhance emotional intimacy and life satisfaction. Therefore, dismissing the idea of marriage for those in love as unwise overlooks the positive effects love can have in a committed relationship. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 2404, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"It is never too late to be what you might have been.\" Do you think this statement is common sense?

Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"It is not just when politicians take sides on criminal cases for political gain\" suggests that it is unfair for politicians to exploit legal situations for their own political advantage. This is because the justice system should operate independently and impartially, without being influenced by political motivations. When politicians interfere in criminal cases to benefit their own agendas, it can undermine public trust in the justice system and potentially skew the outcome of cases, which should be determined based on facts and legal principles rather than political considerations. This aligns with the common understanding of justice and the principle of separation of powers. Therefore, the statement aligns with common sense that justice should be free from political manipulation.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2406, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"It is not necessary to understand things in order to argue about them.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"It is not necessary to understand things in order to argue about them\" suggests that one can engage in discussions or debates without a deep understanding of the topic at hand.

This could be due to the possible delays, bureaucracy, or fear of rejection involved in seeking permission. Additionally, asking for forgiveness after the fact might seem simpler as it deals with consequences that have already occurred, rather than hypotheticals. However, this approach could also strain relationships and trust if used irresponsibly. Ultimately, whether it is easier depends on the specific situation and the potential consequences of bypassing permission.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2413, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"It is often easier to fight for one`s principles than to live up to them.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"It is often easier to fight for one's principles than to live up to them\" suggests that it is simpler to advocate for one's beliefs or values than to consistently embody them in one's actions and decisions. Fighting for principles can involve vocal support or public demonstrations, which can be done intermittently or in specific situations. However, living up to principles requires ongoing commitment and personal integrity, which may involve making difficult choices and sacrifices in everyday life. This can be more challenging as it tests the consistency and authenticity of one's beliefs in various circumstances.\n\nGiven this understanding, the statement aligns with common sense because it highlights the gap between advocating for ideals and the practical application of those ideals in real-life scenarios. It is easier to speak about values than to ensure one's behavior consistently reflects them.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}

While it might not apply universally to every individual, it's plausible that some people subconsciously or consciously create difficulties to find fulfillment in overcoming them, which can be seen in various aspects of life such as puzzles, games, and even professional challenges.\n\nConsidering this perspective, the statement could be seen as a common-sense observation about a specific aspect of human behavior, particularly for those who thrive on problem-solving and the sense of achievement it brings. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2415, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"It is one thing to praise discipline and another to submit to it.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"It is one thing to praise discipline and another to submit to it\" suggests that it is easier to admire or extol the virtues of discipline than it is to actually practice and adhere to it. This aligns with a common understanding that actions are more challenging than words. Many people may agree with the value of discipline in theory\u2014such as its benefits for achieving goals and maintaining order\u2014but find it difficult to implement consistently in their own lives due to various challenges like temptation, procrastination, or lack of motivation.

This perspective aligns with the idea that self-awareness and personal growth can lead to increased empathy and patience. When individuals recognize their own imperfections, they may be more likely to extend grace to others who also have shortcomings. On the other hand, those who are less aware of their own flaws may be quicker to criticize others. This viewpoint encourages self-improvement and compassion, both of which are valuable traits. Therefore, the statement can be seen as reflecting a common sense understanding of human behavior and relationships. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2417, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"It is only reason that teaches silence the heart teaches us to speak.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"It is only reason that teaches silence the heart teaches us to speak\" suggests that rational thought encourages restraint and introspection, while emotions and feelings drive us to express ourselves. Reason involves critical thinking and logical analysis, which can lead to cautious and measured responses. On the other hand, the heart symbolizes passion, intuition, and emotional impulses that often compel individuals to communicate and connect with others.\n\nThis dichotomy between reason and emotion is a common theme in philosophical and psychological discussions about human behavior and decision-making. The idea that reason and emotion serve different roles in guiding our actions is widely acknowledged and aligns with general understanding of cognitive and emotional processes.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}

However, the statement could be referring to the concept of multiple dimensions, parallel universes, or even different perspectives and interpretations of the world within philosophical or metaphysical frameworks. From a scientific standpoint, the idea of multiple worlds or universes is still largely speculative and not conclusively proven. From a philosophical or metaphorical viewpoint, the idea of multiple worlds coexisting as different perspectives or interpretations is more commonly accepted. Therefore, whether this statement is common sense depends on the interpretation of \"worlds\" being used. So the answer is no."}

Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"It's about all of us working together and we can win\" reflects the idea that collaboration and teamwork can lead to success. This is a widely accepted concept in many contexts, including sports, business, and community projects. The idea that collective effort can achieve greater results than individual actions alone is supported by numerous real-world examples and is a fundamental principle in many team-oriented environments.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2440, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"It's better to hang out with people better than you pick out associates whose behavior is better than yours and you'll drift in that direction.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that surrounding oneself with people who exhibit positive behaviors and qualities can influence an individual to adopt similar traits and improve themselves. This idea aligns with the concept of social learning theory, which posits that people learn from observing others. By spending time with individuals who demonstrate admirable behaviors, one may be motivated to emulate those behaviors and consequently improve their own conduct. Additionally, being in the company of individuals who set high standards can challenge and inspire personal growth and development. This perspective implies that the people we associate with can significantly impact our behavior and personal evolution.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2441, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"It's better to live in peace poorly than to be rich and filled with stress.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"It's better to live in peace poorly than to be rich and filled with stress\" reflects the idea that a peaceful and stress-free life, despite financial limitations, is more valuable than a wealthy life burdened with stress. This perspective prioritizes mental and emotional well-being over material wealth. Many people believe that peace of mind and contentment contribute more to overall happiness and life satisfaction than financial success, especially if that success comes with constant anxiety and tension. It is a common viewpoint that aligns with the notion that money cannot buy happiness, and that inner tranquility is of greater importance. \n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2442, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"It's difficult to argue about religious beliefs because they are based on faith.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"It's difficult to argue about religious beliefs because they are based on faith\" suggests that religious beliefs are grounded in personal conviction and trust in a higher power, rather than empirical evidence or logical reasoning. Since faith is a deeply personal and subjective experience, it can be challenging to debate or persuade someone to change their religious beliefs using conventional argumentation. Arguments about faith often reach an impasse because they rely on individual interpretations and experiences that are not universally shared or verifiable. Therefore, the statement reflects a common understanding of the nature of religious beliefs and the challenges associated with discussing them in a logical or argumentative context.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2443, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"It's important to consider all aspects of our future so we do not repeat the past.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that by taking into account all aspects of our future, we can avoid making the same mistakes from the past. This idea is rooted in the belief that history can teach valuable lessons and that foresight can prevent the recurrence of previous errors. Considering all aspects of our future involves thorough planning, reflection, and learning from past experiences, which are generally viewed as practical and wise approaches to decision-making and problem-solving. Hence, the notion of learning from the past to shape a better future can be seen as common sense, as it encourages a thoughtful and comprehensive approach to handling forthcoming challenges.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2444, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"It's not right to give less stimulus money for states who maintain stricter covid 19 measures.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that states with stricter COVID-19 measures should not receive less stimulus money because they are likely imposing these measures to better protect public health and reduce the spread of the virus. Stricter measures may result in greater economic disruptions, leading to a higher need for financial support to mitigate the impact on businesses and individuals. Therefore, it could be argued that these states might actually need more, not less, stimulus money to address the challenges posed by the pandemic. \n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2445, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"It's not what you know it's when you know it.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"It's not what you know it's when you know it\" suggests that timing is more important than knowledge itself. This emphasizes the importance of having the right information at the right time, which can be crucial in making effective decisions or taking advantage of opportunities. In many situations, having information too early or too late can render it less useful or even irrelevant. Thus, the timing of knowledge can often be as important, if not more important, than the knowledge itself. This perspective aligns with common sense as it recognizes the practical implications of information in real-world scenarios.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2446, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"It's obvious that votebymail should be made accessible to all americans during the covid pandemic.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement, \"It's obvious that votebymail should be made accessible to all Americans during the COVID pandemic,\" is based on the idea of ensuring voter safety and accessibility. During the pandemic, social distancing and minimizing physical contact have been key strategies to prevent the spread of the virus. Enabling vote-by-mail for all Americans would allow individuals to participate in the democratic process without risking their health by going to crowded polling places. Additionally, it ensures that those who are immunocompromised or have other health concerns can still exercise their right to vote without fear of exposure. Therefore, making vote-by-mail accessible is a practical solution to uphold democratic participation while prioritizing public health.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2447, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"It's tough to make predictions especially about the future.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"It's tough to make predictions especially about the future\" highlights the inherent uncertainty and unpredictability of future events. Predicting the future involves numerous variables and unknown factors which can change outcomes, making accurate forecasting challenging. Additionally, the future is not predetermined, and new developments or information can arise that were not previously considered. This makes the process of predicting future events inherently difficult and uncertain. Therefore, the statement reflects a common understanding of the limitations and challenges associated with making predictions about future occurrences.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2448, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"It`s perfectly understandable that the wolves call for the sheep to be disarmed sheep`s wool offers a certain resistance to the wolf`s bite.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement is metaphorical and suggests that those in a position of power (wolves) may advocate for disarming those who are vulnerable (sheep) to maintain control and reduce resistance. It implies that disarming the vulnerable makes it easier for the powerful to exploit or harm them. This perspective can be viewed as a commentary on power dynamics and the importance of self-protection for vulnerable groups.\n\nHowever, whether the statement is considered common sense can depend on one's perspective on power dynamics, disarmament, and protection of vulnerable groups. For some, it might be seen as an obvious observation about the nature of exploitation and the need for self-defense. For others, it might require deeper analysis of the metaphor and its implications.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 2449, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"It`s risky in a marriage for a man to come home too late but it can sometimes pose an even greater risk if he comes home too early.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement implies that coming home too late in a marriage could lead to suspicion or concern from a spouse, which makes sense as it could suggest neglect or irresponsibility. However, the statement also suggests that coming home too early could pose a greater risk, which may imply that unexpected early arrivals could lead to discovering undisclosed issues or secrets within the household. This part of the statement plays on the idea of trust and transparency in a relationship. Overall, the statement highlights the importance of communication and mutual understanding in a marriage to avoid misunderstandings based on arrival times. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2450, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"It`s so easy to love the only hard thing is to be loved.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"It's so easy to love, the only hard thing is to be loved\" suggests that expressing love towards others comes naturally, but receiving love in return can be more challenging. This may be due to factors such as fear of rejection, vulnerability, or past experiences that affect one's ability to accept love. It can also relate to the idea that one cannot control how others feel or whether they choose to reciprocate love. While the notion of loving being easy might not universally apply to everyone, as some individuals may struggle with expressing love due to various reasons, the difficulty in being loved resonates as a common emotional challenge faced by many. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2451, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"Its not an anomaly if it happens all the time.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"It's not an anomaly if it happens all the time\" implies that an anomaly refers to something unusual or irregular. If an event or occurrence happens frequently or consistently, it falls within the realm of normalcy or expectation, thereby disqualifying it as an anomaly. Since the definition of an anomaly is something that deviates from what is expected or usual, an event that happens regularly cannot be considered an anomaly by definition. \n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2452, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"Its possible to circumvent the earth due to its spherical shape.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"It's possible to circumvent the earth due to its spherical shape\" refers to the ability to travel around the entire Earth, which is made feasible by its round shape. This concept is supported by basic principles of geography and physics. The spherical shape of the Earth means that one can travel in a continuous path in one direction and eventually return to the starting point. This has been evidenced by numerous explorations and travels around the globe throughout history.\n\nGiven that the Earth's roundness is a well-established scientific fact and that circumnavigation has been practically demonstrated, the statement aligns with both scientific understanding and empirical evidence.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2453, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"Its time to get the senate back up and working again.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"It's time to get the senate back up and working again\" suggests that the senate may not be functioning effectively or efficiently at the moment. It implies a need for improvement or action to ensure that the senate is fulfilling its responsibilities and duties. This can be considered common sense if one believes that a functioning and effective legislative body is essential for good governance and addressing the needs of the people it represents. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2454, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"Its time to send kids back to school.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"It's time to send kids back to school\" can be considered common sense depending on the context. If it refers to resuming in-person education after a temporary closure, such as during a pandemic or natural disaster, and if health and safety measures are in place to protect students and staff, then it may be seen as a reasonable course of action. Education is crucial for children's development, socialization, and future opportunities, and prolonged closures can have negative impacts. However, if conditions are unsafe or if the statement disregards the well-being of the community, it would not be common sense to send kids back to school without proper precautions.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2455, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"Jesus died for our sins.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"Jesus died for our sins\" is based on Christian theological beliefs and is not universally accepted as common sense. Common sense generally refers to practical and sound judgment based on a simple perception of the situation or facts. This statement, however, is rooted in religious faith and doctrine, which may not be considered common sense to those who do not share the same beliefs. Therefore, the acceptance of this statement largely depends on one's religious background and personal beliefs. \n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 2456, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"Jesus is lord.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"Jesus is lord\" is a religious belief held by Christians who view Jesus as the divine Son of God and ruler of the universe. It is a faith-based declaration rooted in Christian theology and scripture. Whether this statement is considered common sense depends on one's personal beliefs and cultural background. For those who follow Christianity, it may be seen as an inherent truth, while for individuals of other faiths or no religious faith, it may not hold the same significance. Common sense typically refers to widely accepted practical judgment, not necessarily religious beliefs that can vary greatly among individuals and cultures. \n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 2457, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"Jesus is one of the primary figures in christianity.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"Jesus is one of the primary figures in Christianity\" is generally considered common sense because Christianity is based on the teachings and life of Jesus Christ. He is central to the Christian faith, and His role as the Son of God and Savior of humanity is foundational to Christian doctrine and belief. The entire religion revolves around His birth, life, death, and resurrection, which are commemorated and celebrated by Christians worldwide.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2458, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"Joe will help with gun violence.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"Joe will help with gun violence\" could be seen as common sense depending on the context and who Joe refers to. If Joe is someone in a position of authority or influence, such as a lawmaker or community leader, it would be reasonable to expect him to help address gun violence. Additionally, if Joe has previously expressed concern or involvement in initiatives related to gun violence, it would also be common sense to expect him to help.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2459, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"John is agreeable if he takes mary up on the offer.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that John's agreeableness is conditional on whether he accepts Mary's offer. Agreeableness, however, is generally considered a personality trait characterized by being pleasant, cooperative, and accommodating in various situations, not just contingent on a single action or decision. Therefore, taking up an offer may not necessarily reflect his overall agreeableness but rather a specific choice in a particular context. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 2460, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"John is likely to get fired if he has a great boss.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"John is likely to get fired if he has a great boss\" does not align with common sense reasoning. Typically, a great boss is characterized as fair, supportive, and effective in managing their team. Such qualities in a boss would generally encourage employee development, address performance issues constructively, and help employees succeed in their roles rather than precipitate their termination. Therefore, having a great boss would more likely contribute to job security and growth rather than an increased likelihood of being fired.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 2461, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"John is thoughtful because he helps mary's mom.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"John is thoughtful because he helps Mary's mom\" implies that John's action of helping Mary's mom is an indication of his thoughtfulness. Common sense suggests that helping someone, especially someone's parent, is a considerate and kind act, which are qualities associated with being thoughtful. Therefore, the statement aligns with the general understanding of thoughtfulness as being considerate and caring towards others.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2462, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"John keeps up jake's spirits by taking him to do fun things.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"John keeps up Jake's spirits by taking him to do fun things\" makes sense as it suggests that engaging in enjoyable activities can have a positive impact on someone's mood and emotional well-being. It is a common understanding that spending time with friends and participating in fun activities can help lift someone's spirits and improve their overall happiness. Therefore, the statement reflects a logical and widely accepted idea.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2463, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"John may look up recipes online if he has never cooked before.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that if John is inexperienced in cooking, he might look up recipes online to guide him. This reasoning aligns with common sense as it is a practical approach for someone who lacks knowledge in a particular area to seek information and guidance. Looking up recipes can provide step-by-step instructions and tips that would be helpful for a beginner in cooking. Therefore, it is reasonable to think that John may use online resources if he is unfamiliar with cooking.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2464, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"John should not believe the news mary brings.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"John should not believe the news Mary brings\" is not necessarily common sense without additional context. Common sense would dictate that the trustworthiness of the news Mary brings depends on her credibility, the source of the news, and the plausibility of the news itself. If Mary has a history of being reliable and truthful, and the news comes from a reputable source, then it would be reasonable for John to believe her. On the other hand, if Mary has a history of dishonesty or the news seems implausible, skepticism might be warranted. Without knowing more about Mary's credibility and the nature of the news, it is difficult to make a blanket statement about whether John should believe her or not. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 2465, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"John will change if mary changes his life.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that John's change is dependent on Mary's influence in his life. It implies that external factors, specifically another person's actions, can affect an individual's behavior or choices. While it is possible for people to be influenced by others, personal change ultimately comes from within and relies on one's own decisions and motivations. Therefore, the statement oversimplifies the complexity of personal change by attributing it solely to another individual's influence.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 2466, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"John will expect mary to be angry if he surprises her.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"John will expect Mary to be angry if he surprises her\" suggests that John is aware that surprising Mary may lead to her feeling angry. This could be common sense if John knows Mary's preferences and past reactions to surprises, and understands that she may not appreciate them. However, the statement's validity also depends on the nature of the surprise and Mary's general disposition towards unexpected events. Without additional context about their relationship and Mary's personality, it's difficult to definitively say whether John expecting Mary to be angry is common sense. However, in general, anticipating a person's reaction based on past experiences and their known preferences can be considered common sense. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2467, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"John will feel happy if he bothers mary.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"John will feel happy if he bothers Mary\" does not align with common sense, as bothering someone typically leads to negative emotions for both parties involved. Common sense suggests that positive interactions and relationships contribute to happiness, not actions that intentionally disturb or upset others. Therefore, it is unlikely that bothering someone would result in genuine happiness. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 2468, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"John will feel sad if mary impresses his girlfriend.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"John will feel sad if Mary impresses his girlfriend\" suggests that John may feel insecure or threatened if Mary, another person, gains the admiration or attention of his girlfriend. This could be interpreted as a natural emotional response, as individuals often feel protective of their relationships and may experience negative emotions if they perceive a threat to that relationship. Therefore, the statement aligns with a common understanding of emotional dynamics in relationships.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2469, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"John will feel successful if he digs himself into a hole.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"John will feel successful if he digs himself into a hole\" is not common sense because digging oneself into a hole is typically associated with negative outcomes and failure, rather than success. In most contexts, \"digging oneself into a hole\" is a metaphor for getting into a difficult or problematic situation that is hard to escape from. Therefore, it would be counterintuitive for someone to feel successful in such a situation. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 2470, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"John will foolishly get into an argument with mary if she speaks with a forked tongue.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that John will react impulsively and negatively if Mary speaks deceitfully or manipulatively, represented by the phrase \"speaks with a forked tongue.\" It portrays a common scenario where one person reacts emotionally to perceived dishonesty or manipulation from another. This kind of reaction is a natural human response, as many people might respond similarly when they feel they are being misled or provoked. Thus, the statement aligns with a common understanding of human behavior in response to deception. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2471, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"John will have good feelings towards mary if she gives him the best gift he had ever gotten.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that John's feelings towards Mary are conditional and dependent on her giving him an impressive gift. This implies a transactional relationship, where positive emotions are contingent upon receiving something of high value. In healthy relationships, good feelings towards someone are usually based on mutual respect, care, and shared experiences, rather than material exchanges. Therefore, it is not common sense to assume that receiving the best gift would be the sole determinant of John's feelings towards Mary. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 2472, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"John will punch mary if she teaches him anything.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"John will punch Mary if she teaches him anything\" is not common sense. Common sense refers to sound practical judgment or reasonable behavior in everyday matters. The idea that someone would respond with violence to being taught something is irrational and unacceptable. Education and learning are generally considered positive interactions, and responding with physical aggression is neither reasonable nor sensible. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 2473, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"John will thank mary if she passes an examination for him.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that John is relying on Mary to pass an examination on his behalf, which implies academic dishonesty. Generally, it is expected that individuals should complete their own examinations to accurately reflect their knowledge and abilities. Depending on others to pass examinations is not a common or ethical practice. Additionally, expressing gratitude for dishonest assistance is not a typical or morally sound reason for giving thanks. \n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 2474, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"John would assume mary is pranking him if she puts her arms around him.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"John would assume Mary is pranking him if she puts her arms around him\" may not necessarily be common sense without additional context. Common sense would depend on the nature of John and Mary's relationship and their history of interactions. If pranking is a common behavior between them, then John might assume that Mary is pranking him. However, if they have a close and affectionate relationship, John might interpret the gesture as a sign of affection rather than a prank. Therefore, without knowing their relationship dynamics, it is difficult to conclude that it is common sense for John to assume a prank. \n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 2475, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"John would be arrested for leaving the town if he forgot to check in with his probation officer.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement reflects common sense as it implies that John is on probation and has certain conditions he must adhere to, such as checking in with his probation officer. Leaving town without informing or getting approval from the probation officer would likely be a violation of probation terms. Consequently, violating probation terms can lead to legal consequences such as arrest. Therefore, the statement aligns with the logical consequences of not complying with legal obligations while on probation.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2476, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"John would feel ashamed if mary bothers him too much.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that John would feel ashamed if Mary bothers him excessively. This implies that John's emotional response to being bothered too much is to feel ashamed, which might not be the most common or typical reaction. Generally, when someone is bothered too much, they might feel annoyed, frustrated, or angry rather than ashamed. Shame is usually associated with a sense of guilt or embarrassment about one's own actions or shortcomings, not necessarily from external bother or annoyance.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 2477, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"John would feel remorseful and apologize if he eats mary's bread.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"John would feel remorseful and apologize if he eats Mary's bread\" assumes that John understands the moral implications of taking something that belongs to someone else without permission, and that he has a sense of empathy and responsibility to make amends. This is a common social norm and expectation in many cultures. However, the statement also assumes knowledge of John's personal values and character, which may not always align with general expectations. Without knowing John's specific personality and moral compass, the statement remains an assumption. Nevertheless, if we consider general social norms and values, it is likely to be expected behavior for someone to feel remorse and apologize after taking something that doesn't belong to them. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2478, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"John would focus on the job when he landed it.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"John would focus on the job when he landed it\" suggests that John would devote his attention and effort to the job once he has secured it. This implies a sense of responsibility and commitment to perform well in the role he has been hired for, which is a common expectation for most individuals when they start a new job. It is reasonable to assume that someone would be focused and motivated to do well in a new position to make a good impression and maintain their employment. Therefore, this statement aligns with typical behavior and expectations in a professional setting.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2479, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"John would laugh on mary's fall if she slipped on a banana peel.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"John would laugh on Mary's fall if she slipped on a banana peel\" suggests that John would find humor in Mary's misfortune, which may not necessarily be true for everyone. Different people have different reactions to such situations, and it is not universally common to find humor in someone else's accident or discomfort. Additionally, laughing at someone's accidental fall could be considered insensitive or inappropriate depending on the context and the relationship between the individuals.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 2480, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"John would make sure to keep quiet and hide all the evidence if he killed mary's brother.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement assumes that John would engage in covering up a crime to avoid being caught or facing consequences, which is a common reaction for someone who has committed a serious offense and wants to evade legal repercussions. However, without knowing John's character, moral values, or the specific circumstances surrounding the hypothetical situation, it's not possible to definitively say whether this statement reflects common sense. Common sense can vary based on individual perspectives and the context of the situation. Therefore, it's not universally applicable to assume that everyone would act in this manner.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 2481, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"John would repeatedly stomp on mary's ankle hoping to set it into place if he broke it.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "Stomping on someone's ankle is not a medically recommended or safe method for setting a broken bone. In fact, it would likely cause further injury and damage. Proper medical treatment from a trained professional is necessary to ensure that a broken bone is set correctly and heals properly. Therefore, stomping on a broken ankle would not be a sensible or effective way to address the injury.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 2482, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"John would start conversation with a smile if he met mary's friend.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"John would start conversation with a smile if he met Mary's friend\" suggests that John is friendly and approachable when meeting new people, particularly those who are friends of someone he already knows. This is a common social behavior, as smiling is generally seen as a positive and welcoming gesture that helps to establish a good rapport in new interactions. It is reasonable to assume that John would want to make a good impression on Mary's friend by being polite and friendly.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2483, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"John would stop exercising if he ate healthier.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"John would stop exercising if he ate healthier\" does not align with common sense. Typically, a healthy lifestyle includes both a balanced diet and regular physical activity. Eating healthier would generally encourage someone to continue or even increase their exercise routine to complement their improved diet, not stop exercising altogether. Therefore, the statement seems counterintuitive to general health principles.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 2484, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"John would use mary's spare keys if she brouht them to him.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"John would use Mary's spare keys if she brought them to him\" suggests that John needs access to something that the keys unlock, and Mary providing the keys would enable him to do so. It is common sense that if someone needs keys to access a locked area and is given those keys, they would use them. Therefore, the statement aligns with logical reasoning and practical behavior.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2485, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"John wouldn't mind if mary decided not to be friends with him.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"John wouldn't mind if Mary decided not to be friends with him\" suggests that John is indifferent or unbothered by the potential loss of Mary's friendship. Whether this statement is considered common sense depends on the context of their relationship and John's personality and values. Common sense would typically dictate that people value friendships and would be affected by their loss. However, if John is portrayed as someone who is emotionally detached or if their friendship is superficial, it might be reasonable to assume he wouldn't mind. Without additional context, it's difficult to definitively classify the statement as common sense.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 2486, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"Joke with a fool at home and he will joke with you in the square.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"Joke with a fool at home and he will joke with you in the square\" suggests that if you engage in casual or joking behavior with someone who may not understand social boundaries or appropriate contexts, they may continue that behavior in public settings where it may not be suitable. The underlying message is that people's behavior in private can often be reflected in their behavior in public, and that one should be mindful of how they interact with others, especially those who may not discern the difference between private and public conduct. This can be seen as a common-sense reminder to be cautious about how we influence others with our actions and to be aware of the potential consequences of our interactions.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2487, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"Josh has the qualities necessary to be a good leader.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"Josh has the qualities necessary to be a good leader\" is not necessarily common sense, as it is subjective and depends on specific information about Josh's qualities and the context in which leadership is required. Common sense typically refers to widely held, practical beliefs or judgments that are generally accepted without the need for specialized knowledge. Without knowing the specifics of Josh's qualities or the criteria for being a good leader in a given situation, one cannot definitively conclude based on common sense alone that Josh possesses the necessary qualities for leadership. So the answer is no."}

Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement draws a comparison between the natural act of rainwater nourishing flowers without expecting anything in return and the idea that sons sharing their wealth selflessly represent the highest form of generosity. The underlying principle is that true generosity is giving without expecting anything in return, similar to how rain provides sustenance to plants selflessly. This concept of selfless giving as an ideal form of generosity is widely recognized and understood in many cultures and philosophies. Therefore, the statement aligns with common beliefs about the nature of true generosity. \n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2489, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"Just because nobody complains doesn`t mean all parachutes are perfect.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that a lack of complaints does not necessarily indicate that there are no problems or defects with parachutes. This is a reminder not to assume perfection or success just because there is an absence of negative feedback. It's important to proactively check and ensure quality, rather than relying solely on complaints to indicate issues. This concept can be applied broadly to various situations beyond parachutes, highlighting the need for vigilance and proactive measures in ensuring safety and quality.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2490, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"Just because you do not take an interest in politics doesn`t mean politics won`t take an interest in you.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement implies that regardless of an individual's interest or engagement in politics, political decisions and policies will still impact their lives. This is true, as laws and regulations enacted by political leaders and government bodies can affect various aspects of daily life, from healthcare and education to taxation and civil liberties. Therefore, it is sensible to recognize that politics influences everyone, whether they actively participate or not.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2491, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"Just when it seems easy be careful.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"Just when it seems easy, be careful\" suggests that when things appear to be going smoothly, one should remain vigilant and cautious. This is rooted in the idea that overconfidence or complacency can lead to unexpected challenges or mistakes. It encourages individuals to maintain a level of awareness and preparedness even in seemingly simple or straightforward situations. This advice is practical and universally applicable, as it helps to prevent potential setbacks by promoting attentiveness.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2492, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"Justice is a temporary thing that must at last come to an end but the conscience is eternal and will never die.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that justice, as a societal or legal construct, is subject to change and has limitations in its duration and scope. On the other hand, it proposes that conscience, as an individual's moral compass, is a constant and enduring guide. The idea that justice can be transient is supported by historical shifts in laws and cultural norms, which evolve over time. The notion that conscience is eternal speaks to the deeply personal and continuous nature of moral and ethical reflection that transcends specific legal or societal frameworks.\n\nThe statement appeals to a philosophical perspective on the nature of justice and conscience, emphasizing the internal and timeless quality of personal moral judgment compared to the external and sometimes temporary application of justice. However, whether this is considered common sense can depend on one's philosophical or cultural viewpoint regarding the relationship between justice and morality.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 2493, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"Justice is entirely dependent of religion.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"Justice is entirely dependent on religion\" suggests that the concepts and practices of justice are solely derived from religious beliefs and teachings. However, justice is a multifaceted concept that can be influenced by various factors, including cultural, societal, and legal frameworks. While many religious traditions have their own moral and ethical guidelines that contribute to their followers' understanding of justice, secular societies and legal systems also establish their own principles of justice that may not be explicitly tied to religious doctrines. Furthermore, different religions may have varying interpretations of what constitutes justice, leading to diverse perspectives. Therefore, it is not accurate to claim that justice is entirely dependent on religion.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 2494, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"Justice is to be found only in the imagination.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"Justice is to be found only in the imagination\" suggests that justice is an ideal concept that exists purely in the realm of thought and cannot be fully realized in reality. This perspective might stem from the observation that real-world justice systems are flawed and can fail to deliver true justice in every situation. However, it's important to recognize that while justice systems are imperfect, they are based on principles and laws designed to promote fairness and accountability, and they do achieve justice in many cases. Therefore, the statement may be overly pessimistic and dismissive of the efforts made to uphold justice in society. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 2495, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"Justice without force is powerless force without justice is tyrannical.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that both justice and force are necessary components for maintaining order and fairness in society. Justice without the means to enforce it may not be effective in upholding the rule of law, while force without the guidance of justice can lead to abuse of power and oppression. Therefore, a balance of both elements is essential to achieve a just and stable society. This idea aligns with common principles of governance and ethics, where power is ideally constrained by laws and moral standards to prevent tyranny and ensure fairness.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}

They play a crucial role in advocating for fair wages, safe working conditions, and reasonable working hours. With the collective bargaining power that unions provide, workers are better equipped to negotiate with employers for better terms of employment. Without unions and workers' rights, employees might be more vulnerable to exploitation and abuse in the workplace. Therefore, considering these points, the statement that labor unions and workers' rights are necessary can be seen as common sense. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2508, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"Labour shortages can often push up prices and cause economic recoveries to slow down.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"Labour shortages can often push up prices and cause economic recoveries to slow down\" is based on the economic principle of supply and demand. When there is a shortage of labor, the supply of workers is low relative to demand. This can lead employers to increase wages to attract and retain employees, which can increase production costs for businesses. These higher costs may be passed on to consumers in the form of higher prices. Additionally, if businesses struggle to find enough workers, they may not be able to produce goods and services at the level needed to meet demand, which can slow down economic growth and recovery. Therefore, the logic behind the statement aligns with fundamental economic concepts. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2509, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"Land masses will continue to shrink as global warming increases glacial melt.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"Land masses will continue to shrink as global warming increases glacial melt\" suggests that as glaciers melt due to rising global temperatures, the land they occupy will diminish. While it's true that glaciers will recede and reduce in size, the underlying landmass itself does not \"shrink\" in terms of its area. The land formerly covered by ice becomes exposed, and although coastal areas may experience loss of land due to rising sea levels from increased water volume, the statement might be misleading if interpreted as all land masses shrinking. Therefore, the accuracy of the statement depends on the interpretation of \"shrink\" in terms of land becoming submerged by water or simply the exposure of land previously under ice.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 2510, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"Laws are made by man natural laws are made by some higher entity.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"Laws are made by man, natural laws are made by some higher entity\" reflects a common distinction between human-made laws, which are constructed by societies to govern behavior, and natural laws, which are perceived as inherent principles governing the universe. The notion of natural laws made by a higher entity often aligns with religious or spiritual beliefs that attribute the order of nature to a divine or supernatural creator.\n\nHowever, the interpretation of natural laws and their origin can vary significantly among different philosophical, scientific, and religious perspectives. While some may view natural laws as divinely ordained, others might see them as intrinsic properties of the universe that can be understood through scientific inquiry, without the need to invoke a higher entity.\n\nGiven the variability in how individuals conceptualize natural laws and their origins, the statement may not universally resonate as common sense, as it presupposes a specific belief in a higher entity responsible for these laws.\n\nSo the answer is no."}

Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"Laws should not be struck down easily\" suggests that there should be a certain level of stability and continuity in the legal system. Laws are typically created through a deliberative process involving elected representatives and are designed to reflect the collective will and values of society. Striking down laws too easily could lead to unpredictability and undermine the rule of law. Additionally, frequent changes in laws can create confusion and make it difficult for individuals and businesses to plan and operate effectively. Therefore, maintaining a stable legal framework is generally seen as beneficial for society as a whole. So the answer is yes."}

Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that environmental protection should be prioritized over political considerations. The rationale behind this is that the environment is a shared resource that sustains life on Earth, and its degradation can have severe and long-lasting consequences for all living beings. Policies that prioritize short-term political gains at the expense of the environment can lead to irreversible damage, threatening not only the current population but also future generations. Environmental laws are therefore essential to ensure that the environment is preserved and protected for the common good.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2514, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"Laziness would make you want to eat breakfast in bed.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that laziness leads to a desire for comfort and convenience, such as eating breakfast in bed. While being lazy might make some people prefer to stay in bed and have their meals there, it is not universally true that all lazy individuals would want to eat breakfast in bed. The desire to eat breakfast in bed can also stem from other reasons such as wanting to relax, enjoy a special occasion, or simply because one enjoys the comfort of their bed. Therefore, associating this behavior solely with laziness might not be an accurate reflection of everyone's motivations. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 2515, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"Leaders should be able to empathize with their workers during a pandemic.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "Empathy is the ability to understand and share the feelings of others, which is essential for leaders to effectively support and communicate with their workers during challenging times such as a pandemic.

This makes sense because evidence-based legislation is informed by real-world information and insights, which can help to identify the most pressing issues, target interventions more precisely, and allocate resources more efficiently. By using evidence to guide decision-making, lawmakers can create policies that are more likely to address the root causes of problems and produce measurable improvements. Furthermore, evidence-based approaches can also enhance transparency and accountability in the legislative process, as decisions are based on objective criteria rather than subjective opinions or political considerations. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2520, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"Legislation requiring more and stricter background checks is not effective because most criminals are not purchasing their guns legally.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement implies that stricter background checks would not prevent criminals from obtaining guns, as they do not typically purchase guns through legal channels where background checks are conducted. However, the effectiveness of background checks should also be considered in terms of preventing individuals who are legally prohibited from owning guns (such as those with certain criminal convictions or mental health issues) from purchasing them legally. While criminals may find other illegal means to acquire guns, background checks can still serve as a preventive measure for reducing gun violence by making it harder for prohibited individuals to obtain firearms legally.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 2521, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"Legislation that focuses on health and safety should be a priority.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"Legislation that focuses on health and safety should be a priority\" is based on the principle that the well-being of citizens is a fundamental responsibility of government. Health and safety laws aim to protect individuals from hazards that could lead to injury, illness, or death, and to maintain a standard of living that promotes a healthy society. When these laws are prioritized, it can lead to improved public health outcomes, reduced healthcare costs, and overall societal stability. Therefore, prioritizing such legislation aligns with the common goal of ensuring a safe and healthy environment for all. So the answer is yes."}

Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"Legislative proposals on climate change must be actionable\" suggests that any proposed laws or regulations aimed at addressing climate change should be practical, implementable, and capable of producing tangible results. This is based on the reasoning that laws which cannot be put into action are ineffective and do not contribute to solving the problem. Given the urgent need to address climate change and its impacts, it is essential that legislative efforts are not only symbolic, but also lead to real and meaningful change. Therefore, the statement aligns with the practical necessity of creating laws that can be realistically enforced and can effectively mitigate climate change. \n\nSo the answer is yes."}

Legislators, who are responsible for creating and implementing policies that address the needs of the public, may respond by expanding medical care to ensure that the healthcare system can adequately support the affected population. This expansion can include increasing funding for healthcare services, broadening coverage, or implementing emergency measures to improve access to medical care.

Equal population distribution among districts helps to achieve balanced representation and ensures that each individual's vote carries the same weight. This is a fundamental aspect of democratic systems and helps uphold the integrity of the electoral process.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}

Blindly offering support without evaluating the situation or considering one's own capacity could lead to negative consequences or enable harmful behaviors. It is essential to exercise discernment and prioritize requests that align with one's values and capabilities. Therefore, while the sentiment of being supportive is positive, it is not practical or advisable to support every time without critical consideration. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 2530, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"Liberals are not good in congress.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"Liberals are not good in congress\" is a subjective opinion and not an objective fact. Whether someone is \"good\" in Congress can depend on a variety of factors including their effectiveness in representing their constituents, their ability to pass legislation, and their overall contributions to the legislative process.

Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"Liberty is the right to do what the law permits\" suggests that freedom is defined and constrained by the laws of a society. This perspective aligns with the idea that individual freedoms must be balanced with the collective order and safety, as laws are typically created to protect and benefit the society as a whole. However, the notion of liberty extends beyond just legal permissions; it also encompasses the right to act according to one's free will within the boundaries of not infringing on others' rights.

The idea is that death is a natural part of life, leading to new beginnings and is essential for the renewal of life. This perspective challenges the common fear and separation that many associate with death by viewing it as an integral part of the life process.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2536, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"Life is short.\" Do you think this statement is common sense?

Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"Lonely people in talking to each other can make each other lonelier\" suggests that interactions between lonely individuals may not necessarily alleviate their loneliness, and could potentially exacerbate it. This could be due to the possibility that discussing their feelings of loneliness might reinforce and amplify those feelings, rather than providing comfort or solace. Additionally, if the individuals are unable to connect or relate to each other in a meaningful way, it could further intensify their sense of isolation.\n\nHowever, it's also important to consider that talking to others in similar situations can provide an opportunity for empathy, understanding, and connection, which can be beneficial in alleviating loneliness. The outcome largely depends on the nature of the interaction and the individuals' ability to effectively communicate and support each other.\n\nSince the statement does not account for the potential positive outcomes and varies depending on individual experiences and interaction quality, it cannot be universally regarded as common sense.

Abolishing the police could potentially lead to increased crime rates and a lack of accountability, which may not be in the best interest of the residents. Therefore, the statement may not be considered common sense as it overlooks the fundamental functions and benefits of having a police force in society.\n\nSo the answer is no."}

Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"Love may turn to indifference with possession\" suggests that once someone possesses what they love, their feelings of passion or desire may diminish and become apathetic. This concept can be understood from a psychological perspective, where the initial excitement and novelty of a relationship or object can fade over time as one becomes accustomed to it. The thrill of the chase or the desire for something unattained can fuel feelings of love, which might wane once the goal is achieved.

{"id": 2563, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"Love would make you want to kiss someone.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"Love would make you want to kiss someone\" is based on the general understanding that love often involves physical expressions of affection, and kissing is a common way to show love and intimacy between two people. When individuals are in love, they typically feel a strong emotional connection and desire to be close to the other person, which can manifest in the desire to kiss.

{"id": 2565, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"Lovers become biographers.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"Lovers become biographers\" suggests that when people are in love, they become deeply interested in learning and telling the story of their loved one's life. This could mean paying close attention to their partner's experiences, memories, and characteristics, much like a biographer would when writing about the subject of their biography.\n\nThis idea could be seen as common sense in the context of a romantic relationship where partners naturally want to know more about each other and may share stories of their pasts, dreams, and aspirations. In a sense, lovers documenting and cherishing each other's life stories is a common aspect of forming a deep emotional connection.\n\nHowever, the statement might not hold universally, as not all lovers take on the role of a biographer in a literal sense, and the depth of interest in each other's histories can vary significantly between relationships. The phrasing may also be metaphorical rather than literal.\n\nGiven the nuanced interpretation and the metaphorical use, it is not strictly common sense that lovers always become biographers in a literal and comprehensive sense. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 2566, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"Lying requires more effort than telling the truth because when you lie you have to remember made up details.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement that \"Lying requires more effort than telling the truth because when you lie you have to remember made up details\" is based on the cognitive load associated with fabricating and maintaining a false narrative. When telling the truth, individuals can rely on their memories and experiences, which do not require additional mental effort to keep consistent. However, when lying, one must create a believable story, remember the details of the lie, and ensure that it remains consistent with any previous statements or evidence.

Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"Make no small plans for they have not the power to stir men's blood\" suggests that ambitious and grand plans are more likely to inspire and motivate people than modest or small-scale plans. This idea is based on the notion that people are more likely to be excited and engaged by big, bold ideas that promise significant impact or change. Large-scale plans can create a sense of purpose and drive, pushing individuals to strive for something greater.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that the statement might not always hold true. Small plans can also be meaningful and impactful, particularly when they are achievable and tailored to specific needs. Additionally, not all grand plans are practical or feasible, and the pursuit of overly ambitious goals without proper resources or planning can lead to failure.\n\nIn conclusion, while the statement highlights the potential motivational power of large-scale plans, it might not be universally applicable or practical in all situations. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 2573, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"Make sure the data that you're dealing with is the data that you think it is.\" Do you think this statement is common sense?

Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that businesses should focus on improving the user's capabilities and experiences rather than solely upgrading the product itself. This can be seen as common sense because when customers feel empowered and capable, they are likely to have a more positive experience with the product and become loyal to the brand. Helping customers achieve their goals can lead to increased satisfaction and potentially drive more sales through positive word-of-mouth. Additionally, improving the customer's skills or abilities can create a sense of value that goes beyond the product's features. Therefore, the statement reflects a customer-centric approach that can be beneficial for both the user and the business.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2575, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"Making the simple complicated is commonplace making the complicated simple awesomely simple that's creativity.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement highlights the idea that true creativity lies in taking something complex and distilling it down to its simplest form, making it easily understandable and accessible. This is often more challenging than complicating something simple, which is a more common occurrence. The ability to simplify complex concepts is a valuable and rare skill that requires deep understanding and innovative thinking. Therefore, the statement emphasizes the significance of simplicity in creative problem-solving and effective communication.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2576, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"Man has two ears and one mouth he should listen more than he talks.\" Do you think this statement is common sense?

The logic behind this is that having two ears and one mouth symbolically implies that listening should be twice as important as talking. Listening allows for better understanding, empathy, and communication in relationships and interactions. By being more receptive to others' ideas and thoughts, individuals can gain more knowledge and perspective. Additionally, effective listening can help prevent misunderstandings and conflicts. Therefore, the statement encourages a valuable communication principle that can lead to more harmonious and productive interactions.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2577, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"Man makes holy what he believes as he makes beautiful what he loves.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"Man makes holy what he believes as he makes beautiful what he loves\" suggests that human perception and emotions play a significant role in assigning value and meaning to things. When someone believes in something, they may elevate it to a sacred or revered status, similar to how they may see beauty in things they love, even if others don\u2019t perceive it the same way. This indicates that subjectivity and personal attachment are key factors in how humans perceive holiness and beauty. This idea aligns with common psychological and sociological understanding that human emotions and beliefs shape their perceptions and reality. Therefore, the statement reflects a commonly understood concept about human nature and subjectivity.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2578, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"Man speaks by being silent.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"Man speaks by being silent\" suggests that silence can communicate messages just as effectively as words. It implies that through silence, a person can convey emotions, thoughts, or intentions without speaking. In some contexts, such as during moments of reflection, mourning, or tension, silence can be a powerful form of communication. It allows individuals to express themselves in ways that words cannot capture. Therefore, the statement highlights the idea that communication is not limited to verbal expressions, but also includes non-verbal cues like silence.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2579, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"Mandating the wearing of face masks does not infringe on our first amendment rights.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The First Amendment of the United States Constitution protects freedoms concerning religion, expression, assembly, and the right to petition. It prohibits Congress from restricting the press or the rights of individuals to speak freely. Mandating the wearing of face masks for public health reasons, such as during a pandemic, is a measure that primarily concerns public safety and health. It does not target or restrict any form of expression, religious practice, or assembly in its intent. Instead, it is a general directive aimed at mitigating the spread of disease. Therefore, requiring face masks does not directly impact the freedoms guaranteed by the First Amendment. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2580, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"Manslaughter is a violent crime.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "Manslaughter is a type of homicide that involves the unlawful killing of another person without premeditation or malice aforethought. It typically occurs in situations where an individual unintentionally causes the death of another person, either through negligence or during the commission of another unlawful act that does not rise to the level of murder. Given that manslaughter involves the act of causing another person's death, it can be categorized as a violent crime because it results in physical harm to the victim. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2581, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"Manual labor that involves little knowledge of doing a task shouldn't require a license.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement hinges on the idea that manual labor requiring minimal specialized knowledge may not necessitate formal licensing. Licensing is typically used to regulate professions where specialized knowledge and skills are necessary to ensure safety and competence. In tasks where the skills required are basic and the risks are low, the bureaucracy and expense of licensing may be seen as an unnecessary barrier. It could be argued that for simple manual labor tasks, on-the-job training or minimal instruction may suffice to maintain quality and safety standards. \n\nHowever, it is important to consider that even tasks that seem simple could have underlying complexities or safety implications that warrant some form of oversight or regulation. The need for licensing could also depend on the specific context or industry in which the labor is being performed.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 2582, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"Many democrat legislators are not fit to be in congress.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"Many democrat legislators are not fit to be in congress\" is a subjective opinion and not necessarily a reflection of common sense. Common sense typically refers to sound practical judgment that is based on simple perception of the situation or facts. Whether or not legislators are fit to serve in Congress would depend on various factors such as their performance, integrity, and adherence to the law, rather than their political affiliation. Making a blanket statement about the fitness of legislators from a particular party without specific evidence or context does not align with common sense reasoning. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 2583, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"Many of my friends became my enemies many enemies become friends only those who never cared either way remained constant.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement speaks to the dynamic nature of human relationships, where friendships and enmities can change over time due to various circumstances. It also highlights the idea that those who are indifferent remain unaffected by these changes. This reflects a common understanding of how relationships can evolve and the impact of indifference. It is a relatable concept as many people experience shifts in their social circles throughout life.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2584, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"Many world religions were inspired by each other.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"Many world religions were inspired by each other\" can be considered common sense because throughout history, different cultures and societies have come into contact with one another through trade, migration, and conquest. This interaction often led to the exchange of ideas, including religious beliefs and practices. For example, elements of Hinduism influenced Buddhism, and Zoroastrianism influenced Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. Additionally, the spread of religions along trade routes, such as the Silk Road, facilitated the blending and adaptation of religious concepts between different regions. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that world religions have influenced and inspired each other over time.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2585, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"Many would be cowards if they had courage enough.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"Many would be cowards if they had courage enough\" appears to be a paradox at first, but it suggests that if people had the courage to honestly face their fears and acknowledge their limitations, they might realize that they are not as brave as they pretend to be. It implies that self-awareness and honesty about one's own fears can ironically make someone more of a coward, because they are no longer hiding behind a facade of bravery. The statement challenges the conventional understanding of courage and cowardice, pointing out the complexity of human behavior and the role of self-perception in determining one's actions. \n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2586, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"Mapping of the globe is as we see it is inaccurate on a flat surface.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"Mapping of the globe as we see it is inaccurate on a flat surface\" refers to the challenge of representing the curved, three-dimensional surface of the Earth on a two-dimensional map. This process inevitably introduces distortions because it's impossible to perfectly preserve distances, shapes, areas, and directions all at the same time when converting from a spherical to a flat surface. Common map projections, such as the Mercator projection, maintain accurate shapes and directions but distort areas, especially near the poles. Other projections might preserve area but distort shapes. Given this inherent limitation in cartography, the statement aligns with the fundamental principles of geographical representation.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2587, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"Marriage is like life it is a field of battle.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"Marriage is like life it is a field of battle\" is a metaphor that suggests marriage, like life, involves challenges and conflicts that require effort and resilience to overcome. While marriage can indeed have its difficulties and require negotiation and compromise, viewing it solely as a \"battlefield\" might be an overly negative and combative perspective. Healthy marriages are typically characterized by love, mutual respect, and cooperation, rather than constant conflict. Therefore, while the statement might hold some truth in the sense that marriage requires effort, it may not be the most constructive or universally applicable analogy.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 2588, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"Martha would make a great legislator for the people.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"Martha would make a great legislator for the people\" is subjective and depends on various factors such as Martha's qualifications, experience, values, and ability to represent her constituents effectively. Without specific information about Martha's background and skills, it is difficult to determine whether this statement is common sense. Common sense typically involves practical judgment and sound reasoning based on observable facts, which are not provided in this statement.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 2589, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"Marthas is in a difficult election in speaking out for conservative values.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"Marthas is in a difficult election in speaking out for conservative values\" suggests that Marthas is facing challenges in expressing conservative views during an election period. This could be due to various factors such as the political climate, opposition from other candidates or parties, or differing public opinions. If the election environment is predominantly liberal or if conservative values are not popular among the electorate, it would indeed be difficult for Marthas to advocate for conservative values. Therefore, the statement could be seen as common sense if the context supports these challenges.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2590, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"Mary ensures justice by enforcing her rights.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"Mary ensures justice by enforcing her rights\" suggests that by asserting her legal entitlements, Mary contributes to the fairness and equity in her environment. This can be seen as common sense because rights are established to protect individuals' freedoms and ensure fair treatment under the law. By enforcing her rights, Mary is actively participating in a system designed to maintain justice and uphold societal standards. Therefore, it appears logical that Mary's actions in enforcing her rights would contribute to the broader concept of justice.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2591, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"Mary is unkind if she steals john's thunder.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"Mary is unkind if she steals John's thunder\" suggests that taking away attention or recognition from someone else, in this case, John, is an unkind action. Common sense would indicate that deliberately overshadowing or diminishing someone else's moment or achievement can be considered inconsiderate or disrespectful. Therefore, describing such behavior as unkind aligns with general social norms and ethical understanding that emphasize treating others with respect and fairness.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2592, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"Mary will be disrespectful if john shows her respect.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"Mary will be disrespectful if John shows her respect\" seems counterintuitive to common social norms and psychological understanding. Generally, when someone is shown respect, it fosters positive feelings and reciprocal respect. The statement portrays an atypical reaction and does not align with typical behavioral expectations. Therefore, it does not represent common sense as it contradicts the expected outcome of mutual respect. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 2593, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"Mary will be full if she eats a lot of food.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"Mary will be full if she eats a lot of food\" is based on a basic understanding of human biology and appetite. When a person consumes a large quantity of food, their stomach becomes filled, which triggers signals of satiety to the brain, leading the person to feel full. This is a general physiological response that is commonly expected after eating a substantial amount of food. Therefore, considering this basic knowledge, the statement aligns with common sense.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2594, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"Mary will behave immaturely and not save money for the future of john and her sister if they marry.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement makes assumptions about Mary's behavior and her financial responsibility, which may not necessarily be true or fair without additional context or evidence about her character and habits. It is important not to generalize or predict someone's actions based solely on a hypothetical situation. Therefore, it is not necessarily common sense to agree with the statement as it lacks sufficient information and justification.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 2595, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"Mary will feel happy if she helps john.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"Mary will feel happy if she helps John\" is based on the assumption that helping others leads to feelings of happiness and fulfillment. Research in psychology suggests that performing acts of kindness and helping others can increase feelings of well-being and satisfaction. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that if Mary helps John, she may experience positive emotions as a result of her actions. This aligns with the general understanding that helping others can be emotionally rewarding.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2596, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"Mary would be grateful if john took her family out for dinner.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that Mary would appreciate it if John took her family out for dinner, which is a kind gesture that would likely be well-received.

So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2597, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"Mary would discourage john from being a teacher.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"Mary would discourage John from being a teacher\" lacks context and information about the relationship between Mary and John, as well as their individual motivations and perspectives on the teaching profession. Without knowing Mary's reasons for potentially discouraging John or understanding John's interest and aptitude for teaching, it is not possible to determine if the statement is common sense. Common sense would typically require an understanding of the situation and the motivations of the individuals involved. \n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 2598, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"Mary would feel alone if john set her apart from others.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that if Mary were isolated by John, she would feel alone. This makes sense because being set apart from others often leads to feelings of loneliness and disconnection. Human beings are inherently social creatures, and being separated from others can impact emotional well-being. Therefore, it is common sense to think that Mary would feel alone if she were isolated by John. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2599, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"Mary would feel scared if john came near her.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"Mary would feel scared if John came near her\" depends on the context of Mary and John's relationship and any past interactions they may have had. If there is a history of negative or threatening behavior from John towards Mary, it would be common sense for Mary to feel scared. However, if John and Mary have a positive or neutral relationship, it would not necessarily be common sense for Mary to feel scared. Without additional context, it's not possible to definitively say whether the statement is common sense. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 2600, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"Mary would feel thankful if john ironed her clothes.\" Do you think this statement is common sense?

It is common for people to feel thankful when someone does something kind or helpful for them, especially if it eases their workload or saves them time. In this context, ironing clothes can be seen as a considerate gesture, and it is natural for someone to appreciate such an act. Therefore, the statement aligns with common social norms and expectations regarding gratitude for helpful actions. So the answer is yes."}

Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"Nature is ever changing and as it changes it disappears\" suggests that as natural elements undergo transformation, they cease to exist in their original form. This concept aligns with the idea of impermanence in nature, where everything is in a constant state of flux and renewal. For example, a tree may shed its leaves, which decompose and contribute to the formation of new soil, supporting the growth of new plants. In this sense, the tree's leaves \"disappear\" as they transform into something else. However, the statement could also be interpreted to mean that nature itself is vanishing entirely, which would be an exaggeration. Nature as a whole continues to exist, even though individual elements within it change and transform. Thus, the statement captures a fundamental truth about the transient nature of individual elements within the environment, but could be misleading if taken to imply the complete disappearance of nature itself. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2681, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"Nature is going to be around long after humans are.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"Nature is going to be around long after humans are\" reflects the idea that the natural world, including ecosystems, plants, and animals, has a resilience and ability to adapt and survive beyond the existence of humans. Considering the vast timeline of Earth's history, nature has persisted through various mass extinctions and environmental changes, while human existence represents a relatively short period. Additionally, human activities that impact the environment negatively could potentially lead to scenarios where human survival becomes challenging, yet some form of nature may continue. Given the resilience of nature and its long history compared to human existence, it seems reasonable to conclude that nature could outlast humanity.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2682, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"Need would make you want to buy something.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"Need would make you want to buy something\" suggests that when a person has a necessity or requirement for a particular item, they are more likely to have the desire to purchase it. This is based on the basic principle of fulfilling needs to ensure survival, comfort, or to improve quality of life. For example, if someone is hungry, they need food, and therefore, they would want to buy food. This concept aligns with common economic and psychological understanding of human behavior, where needs drive demand for goods and services. \n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2683, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"Needing a hard copy would make you want to print on the printer.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"Needing a hard copy would make you want to print on the printer\" suggests that having a need for a physical document would naturally lead to using a printer to produce that document. This is based on the common understanding that printers are devices used to create hard copies from digital files. The logical connection between needing a hard copy and using a printer to obtain it is straightforward and aligns with typical usage scenarios for printers. Therefore, the statement reflects a commonly understood and practical approach to obtaining physical copies of documents.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2684, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"Needing exercise would make you want to jog.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"Needing exercise would make you want to jog\" implies a logical connection between recognizing a need for physical activity and choosing jogging as a means to fulfill that need. It is based on the assumption that if someone understands they need exercise, they might be motivated to engage in an activity like jogging, which is a common form of exercise that can help improve cardiovascular health, build endurance, and burn calories. However, the desire to jog specifically might not apply to everyone, as individuals have different preferences for exercise types. Despite this, the general idea that needing exercise could lead to a desire to engage in some form of physical activity like jogging does align with common sense. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2685, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"Needing money would make you want to go to work.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"Needing money would make you want to go to work\" is based on the idea that work is a means of earning money to fulfill financial needs. It is a common motivation for many people to seek employment as it provides the necessary income to cover daily expenses, bills, and other financial obligations. The need for money creates an incentive to work in order to secure financial stability and independence. Therefore, it is a logical and relatable reason for wanting to go to work. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2686, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"Needing money would make you want to wait on tables.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"Needing money would make you want to wait on tables\" is based on the idea that if someone is in need of money, they may be motivated to take a job that can provide quick and relatively easy income, such as waiting tables. Waiting tables can offer flexible hours and the potential for tips, making it a viable option for those in immediate need of cash. However, the desire to wait tables can also depend on individual circumstances, preferences, and other available job opportunities. It is not the only option for making money, but it is a common choice for those in need of quick financial support.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2687, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"Needing money would make you want to work.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"Needing money would make you want to work\" is based on the idea that individuals are motivated to work in order to fulfill their financial needs. In most societies, money is essential for purchasing necessities such as food, shelter, and clothing, as well as for accessing various services and luxuries. Therefore, when someone is in need of money, they are more likely to seek employment or other income-generating opportunities to meet those needs. This motivation is a fundamental aspect of economic behavior and is commonly understood as a driving force behind why people work. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2688, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"Never believe anything in politics until it has been officially denied.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests skepticism towards political statements and encourages questioning official narratives until they are explicitly contradicted. This can be seen as a way to promote critical thinking and prevent acceptance of misinformation. However, it's also possible that not everything in politics requires denial to be believed, as some truthful information may be readily shared without denial. Believing that something is true only after it has been denied could lead to a distorted view of reality and excessive cynicism. Therefore, the statement might not always align with common sense as it promotes a somewhat distrustful approach to information in politics.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 2689, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"Never confuse a single defeat with a final defeat.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"Never confuse a single defeat with a final defeat\" speaks to the idea of resilience and perseverance. It suggests that one should not view a single setback as an ultimate failure, but rather as a temporary obstacle that can be overcome. This perspective is valuable in maintaining motivation and continuing to strive towards goals despite challenges. The notion of learning from failures and using them as stepping stones to success is a common and practical approach in both personal and professional growth. \n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2690, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"Never express yourself more clearly than you think.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"Never express yourself more clearly than you think\" suggests that one should only communicate ideas or thoughts to the extent that they are fully formed and understood in their own mind. This approach can help prevent misunderstandings, miscommunication, and the spread of inaccurate information. It encourages careful consideration and reflection before speaking or writing, ensuring that the communicator has a solid grasp of their thoughts and can articulate them effectively.\n\nHowever, this statement can also be limiting as it may discourage open dialogue and the exchange of ideas that are still being developed. Communication is a process that can involve clarifying thoughts through discussion and feedback. By only expressing fully formed thoughts, opportunities for collaborative thinking and problem-solving might be missed.\n\nGiven the benefits of clear and accurate communication but also considering the value of open dialogue and idea exchange, the statement might be too restrictive in some contexts. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 2691, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"Never feel remorse for what you have thought about your wife she has thought much worse things about you.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that one should not feel guilty about negative thoughts towards their spouse because the spouse has likely had similar or worse thoughts. However, this statement is not common sense as it promotes a lack of accountability for one's thoughts and disregards the importance of healthy communication and mutual respect in a relationship. It also assumes negative thoughts are normal and reciprocal, which may not be the case in all relationships. Encouraging such a dismissive attitude towards one's thoughts and feelings can be damaging to the trust and emotional intimacy between partners. Healthy relationships thrive on open communication, understanding, and empathy, not on assumptions and disregard for each other's feelings.\n\nSo the answer is no."}

Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"Never go on trips with anyone you do not love\" suggests that traveling with someone you have a strong emotional connection with will make the experience more enjoyable and fulfilling. However, there are many instances where people travel with colleagues, friends, or acquaintances for various reasons such as work, adventure, or learning opportunities. These trips can still be rewarding and successful even without the element of love. Moreover, traveling with different people can lead to new experiences and perspectives that one might not encounter otherwise. Therefore, the statement might not be practical or applicable in all situations. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 2693, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"Never half ass two things whole ass one thing.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement advises individuals to focus their efforts on one task at a time, ensuring it is done well, rather than spreading themselves too thin across multiple tasks and risking subpar results. This idea aligns with the common-sense principle of prioritization and dedicating sufficient resources to a task to achieve success. Concentrating on one task allows for greater attention to detail and higher quality outcomes. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2694, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"Never interrupt your enemy when he is making a mistake.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"Never interrupt your enemy when he is making a mistake\" suggests that allowing your enemy to continue making errors can be advantageous to you, as it may weaken their position or lead to their own downfall. From a strategic perspective, this can be seen as common sense because it emphasizes the importance of patience and foresight in capitalizing on an opponent's mistakes. By not intervening, you allow the mistake to fully develop and potentially create greater opportunities for you to gain an upper hand. Therefore, the statement aligns with the idea of using an enemy's errors to your own benefit without having to actively engage or confront them.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2695, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"Never regret if it's good it's wonderful if it's bad it's experience.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"Never regret if it's good it's wonderful if it's bad it's experience\" suggests that every life experience, positive or negative, has value. This perspective encourages a growth mindset and resilience, as it frames challenges and setbacks as opportunities for learning and personal development. By adopting this mindset, individuals can cultivate a more positive outlook on life and reduce feelings of regret. This approach aligns with common psychological principles that emphasize the importance of learning from experiences and adapting to life's ups and downs.

Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"Never say 'oops' always say 'ah interesting'\" suggests adopting a positive and curious attitude towards mistakes or unexpected outcomes instead of expressing disappointment or regret. This approach can encourage a growth mindset, where challenges are seen as opportunities for learning and improvement, rather than as failures. Adopting this attitude can help individuals and teams to stay motivated and resilient, and foster a more supportive and innovative environment. Therefore, this statement reflects a sensible approach to handling mistakes and challenges.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2697, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"Never throw mud you may miss your mark but you will have dirty hands.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"Never throw mud you may miss your mark but you will have dirty hands\" suggests that attempting to harm or discredit others can backfire and leave you worse off than before. This metaphor emphasizes the potential negative consequences of engaging in malicious behavior. It highlights the importance of maintaining integrity and refraining from actions that could harm oneself or others. It serves as a reminder to consider the repercussions of one's actions and to choose a higher moral ground.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2698, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"Never was anything great achieved without danger.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"Never was anything great achieved without danger\" suggests that taking risks is a necessary component of accomplishing significant feats. This idea aligns with the common understanding that stepping out of one's comfort zone and facing challenges is often required to achieve extraordinary outcomes. Many historical and contemporary examples support the notion that great achievements often involve overcoming obstacles and facing uncertainties. Therefore, it can be considered common sense that significant accomplishments typically come with associated risks or dangers. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2699, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"New mexico was once a part of mexico.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"New Mexico was once a part of Mexico\" is based on historical facts. New Mexico was originally inhabited by indigenous peoples and then became part of the Spanish Empire in the 16th century. After Mexico gained independence from Spain in 1821, New Mexico became part of the territory of Mexico. It wasn't until the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo in 1848, following the Mexican-American War, that New Mexico was ceded to the United States. Therefore, the statement is rooted in historical events and is accurate. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2700, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"New york city is one of the largest in the united states.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"New York City is one of the largest in the United States\" is generally considered common sense because New York City is widely known for its significant population and influence. It is one of the most populous cities in the United States, and its cultural, financial, and media impact is recognized both nationally and internationally. This information is commonly known and accepted, making the statement about its size a matter of common knowledge. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2701, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"No doubt we will have many similar debates in the coming weeks.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"No doubt we will have many similar debates in the coming weeks\" suggests a certainty about future events based on current or past experiences. If there have been frequent debates recently or if the context involves ongoing contentious issues, it would be reasonable to expect that similar debates will continue. The use of \"no doubt\" emphasizes a strong belief in the likelihood of this outcome. \n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2702, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"No evil can happen to a good man either in life or after death.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"No evil can happen to a good man either in life or after death\" suggests that being good provides a form of protection against harm or suffering. However, real-life experiences and observations indicate that good people can and do experience misfortune, suffering, and injustice, regardless of their moral character. Additionally, the concept of what constitutes \"evil\" can be subjective and varies across different cultures and belief systems. Thus, the statement seems to oversimplify the complexities of life and moral consequences.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 2703, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"No god really exist.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"No god really exists\" is a philosophical and theological assertion that involves personal beliefs and interpretations of existence. Common sense refers to practical and sound judgment based on simple perception or a general consensus. Since beliefs about the existence of deities vary greatly among individuals and cultures and often depend on faith or specific religious teachings rather than universally agreed-upon evidence or perception, the statement does not align with the definition of common sense. Therefore, whether or not gods exist is not a matter of common sense but of personal or cultural belief. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 2704, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"No knock warrants set a dangerous precedent on the part of the police.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "No-knock warrants allow law enforcement officers to enter a property without prior notification to the residents, typically in high-risk situations or when evidence is likely to be destroyed. While these warrants can be necessary in certain circumstances, they also carry significant risks, such as the potential for violent confrontations, injury or death to both residents and officers, and violations of privacy and property rights. Additionally, there have been instances where no-knock warrants were issued based on incorrect information, leading to wrongful raids on innocent people's homes. These factors contribute to the argument that no-knock warrants set a dangerous precedent, as they may erode public trust in law enforcement and compromise the safety and rights of individuals. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2705, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"No law or ordinance is mightier than understanding.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"No law or ordinance is mightier than understanding\" implies that understanding, or knowledge and insight, is more powerful and effective than mere rules or regulations. This perspective emphasizes the importance of comprehension and wisdom in guiding behavior and decision-making, suggesting that laws are insufficient on their own without the underpinning of true understanding. Laws can govern external actions, but understanding influences thoughts, motives, and internal decisions, which can lead to more profound and lasting effects on behavior.\n\nConsidering the depth and scope of how understanding can influence not just actions but also beliefs and values, it is a reasonable assertion that understanding is indeed mightier than laws or ordinances. Laws are tools to maintain order, but understanding fosters genuine change and compliance based on insight rather than coercion or fear of punishment.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2706, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"No man ever steps in the same river twice for it`s not the same river and he`s not the same man.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement in question suggests that both the river and the person are in a constant state of change and flux. The river's water is always flowing and changing, and similarly, a person's experiences, thoughts, and physical state are also never static. The idea is rooted in the philosophy of Heraclitus, who believed that change is the only constant in life.\n\nThis statement can be seen as a metaphor for the impermanence and ever-changing nature of life and existence. It challenges the notion of fixed identity and static environments, encouraging a deeper reflection on the nature of reality and our interactions with the world.\n\nWhile the statement may not be immediately obvious or intuitive in a literal sense, it does convey a deeper philosophical truth about change and transformation that can be considered common sense when interpreted metaphorically.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2707, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"No man means all he says and yet very few say all they mean for words are slippery and thought is viscous.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that communication is inherently flawed, as people may not always express their full intentions or thoughts through their words. It acknowledges the limitations of language and the complexity of human thought, which can be difficult to articulate precisely. Given that people often use language strategically, and that misinterpretations and misunderstandings are common in everyday interactions, the statement reflects a realistic view of human communication. Additionally, the idea that words can be ambiguous and thoughts can be complex is widely acknowledged in fields such as linguistics and psychology.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2708, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"No one becomes a good doctor before he fills a churchyard.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"No one becomes a good doctor before he fills a churchyard\" is a figurative way of saying that doctors may inevitably make mistakes during their careers, and those mistakes could result in fatalities. It suggests that experience, including learning from errors, is necessary to become a competent doctor. However, the phrase is hyperbolic and morbid, as it exaggerates the idea that numerous deaths are a prerequisite for medical proficiency.\n\nThis statement is not common sense, as it overly dramatizes the learning process and implies an acceptance of fatalities as a normal part of medical training and practice. In reality, medical professionals strive to minimize errors and prevent fatalities through rigorous training, continued education, and adherence to ethical standards. The statement does not reflect the true goals and responsibilities of the medical profession, which prioritize patient safety and care.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 2709, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"No one is born without vices and he is the best man who is encumbered with the least.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that everyone is born with inherent flaws or vices, and that the measure of a good person is based on having the fewest vices. This idea aligns with the common understanding that no one is perfect and that striving to minimize one's flaws is a commendable goal. It reflects a realistic and pragmatic view of human nature, acknowledging imperfections while also valuing self-improvement and moral character. Therefore, this statement can be seen as common sense as it resonates with widely held beliefs about personal growth and moral integrity. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2710, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"No one is so brave that he is not disturbed by something unexpected.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"No one is so brave that he is not disturbed by something unexpected\" suggests that regardless of one's courage, unexpected events can still cause disturbance or unease. This aligns with the general understanding of human psychology and emotions, where unexpected changes or surprises can trigger a stress response even in the most courageous individuals. It is a reflection of the natural human instinct to feel some level of discomfort or anxiety when faced with uncertainty or sudden changes. This is a common experience shared by many, which supports the idea that the statement is rooted in common sense.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2711, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"No one religion is the right path.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"No one religion is the right path\" suggests that there are multiple valid approaches to spirituality and that no single religion has a monopoly on truth. This perspective aligns with pluralism, which acknowledges and appreciates the diversity of religious beliefs and practices. It also allows for inclusivity and encourages dialogue among different faiths. The idea that no one religion is the right path recognizes that individuals may have different needs and experiences that lead them to connect with different religious or spiritual paths.\n\nGiven the diverse and multicultural world we live in, where people from various backgrounds coexist and interact, it makes sense to adopt a pluralistic and open-minded approach to religion. By acknowledging that no one religion is the right path, we promote tolerance, understanding, and peaceful coexistence among different religious communities.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2712, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"No one writes a love song about a wrench.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"No one writes a love song about a wrench\" speaks to the idea that love songs are typically written about emotionally charged subjects, such as romantic relationships, heartbreak, or affection, rather than inanimate objects like tools. A wrench, being a practical item used for mechanical purposes, does not naturally evoke the emotional depth and human experience usually explored in love songs. While it's possible for a songwriter to creatively use a wrench as a metaphor or in a whimsical way, it's generally not the central focus of traditional love songs. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2713, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"No two places are exactly the same but many places are very similar to one another.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"No two places are exactly the same but many places are very similar to one another\" is grounded in the understanding that each location has unique characteristics, such as geographical features, climate, culture, and history. However, many places can share similarities in these aspects, making them comparable to one another. For example, two coastal cities in different parts of the world may have similar weather patterns, economic activities centered around maritime trade, and a vibrant beach culture. This balance of uniqueness and similarity is a common observation in human geography and environmental science. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2714, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"Nobody can be injured by a law that is not enforceable.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"Nobody can be injured by a law that is not enforceable\" may initially seem logical, as unenforceable laws typically lack the power to affect individuals directly. However, the impact of a law is not solely determined by its enforceability. Unenforceable laws can still cause harm indirectly by perpetuating social stigmas, encouraging discrimination, or fostering a sense of uncertainty and fear among certain groups. Additionally, the existence of such laws can signal societal approval of certain harmful attitudes or behaviors, which can contribute to injury or harm even if the law itself is not actively enforced. \n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 2715, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"Nobody else has provided that response.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"Nobody else has provided that response\" implies that a unique or original answer has been given that differs from others' responses. This statement can be considered common sense when it is clear that the context involves collecting multiple responses from different sources or individuals, and it is evident that the response in question stands out as distinct. If it's apparent that responses are being compared or evaluated for uniqueness, then it is reasonable to conclude that the statement is based on common sense observation.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2716, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"None other than the world health organization who has changed its position.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that only the World Health Organization has changed its position on an issue, which may not necessarily be common sense. In many situations, it's common for multiple organizations, not just the WHO, to change their positions as new information becomes available, especially in fields like public health. The statement doesn't provide any evidence that the WHO is the only organization to have changed its position, which makes it less likely to be considered common sense.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 2717, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"Not all ideas are good.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"Not all ideas are good\" suggests that some ideas may be ineffective, harmful, or impractical, while others could be beneficial and valuable. This notion aligns with common sense because it acknowledges the diversity and variability in the quality of ideas. It reflects the understanding that not everything conceived or proposed will necessarily lead to positive outcomes. Therefore, it is sensible to critically evaluate ideas rather than accepting them all as equally good.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2718, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"Not all people are created with the same level of intelligence.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"Not all people are created with the same level of intelligence\" is generally considered to be common sense because it reflects observable differences in cognitive abilities among individuals. Intelligence can be influenced by a variety of factors including genetics, environment, and educational opportunities, leading to variations in intellectual capacities across different people. It is widely recognized and accepted in both scientific research and everyday observations that individuals differ in their intellectual abilities and problem-solving skills. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2719, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"Not being rich makes you happy but to become rich.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"Not being rich makes you happy but to become rich\" appears to be contradictory and confusing. It suggests that being poor leads to happiness, yet it also implies that the goal is to become rich. This contradiction makes it difficult to determine a clear, common sense interpretation of the statement. Happiness and wealth are subjective and can vary greatly between individuals. Some might find happiness in simplicity and minimalism, while others might equate happiness with financial success and wealth accumulation.\n\nGiven the unclear and contradictory nature of the statement, it does not align with common sense, which typically relies on clarity and logical consistency. \n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 2720, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"Not cohabitation but consensus constitutes marriage.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that marriage is fundamentally based on mutual agreement and understanding between partners, rather than simply living together. This aligns with the idea that the essence of a marriage is the commitment and consent between individuals, which are critical for a healthy and sustainable relationship. Cohabitation may be a component of many marriages, but it alone does not define the marriage. The consensus, or the deliberate choice to be partners in life, is what truly constitutes the union. This perspective emphasizes the importance of emotional and intellectual agreement over mere physical coexistence.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}

Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that work is defined by a preference for engaging in alternative activities. This implies that work is inherently undesirable or less enjoyable compared to other options. However, this perspective overlooks the possibility that many individuals may find fulfillment, purpose, and satisfaction in their work, making it something they willingly choose over other activities. Additionally, the concept of work varies widely among individuals and can encompass passion projects, hobbies turned careers, and other enjoyable and meaningful pursuits. Therefore, defining work solely based on a preference for doing something else is overly simplistic and does not account for the diverse experiences and attitudes towards work. \n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 2730, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"Nothing stings us so bitterly as the loss of money.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"Nothing stings us so bitterly as the loss of money\" suggests that the loss of money is the most painful experience one can have. While it is true that losing money can be distressing due to the impact it can have on one's financial stability and security, it is subjective to assert that it is the most bitter sting for everyone.

Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"One and one don't always make 2\" can be interpreted in different ways depending on the context. In the literal sense of arithmetic with numbers, one and one always make two. However, if we consider other contexts such as combining elements or ideas, the result may not be as straightforward. For example, when mixing colors, combining one part of blue with one part of yellow results in green, not two. Similarly, in certain situations in physics or other sciences, combining two units may result in a different outcome due to various factors. Therefore, the statement suggests a broader perspective beyond simple arithmetic, reflecting on cases where combining two units may not result in a straightforward sum.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2745, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"One apple a day get the doctor away.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"One apple a day keeps the doctor away\" is a proverb that suggests eating an apple daily can contribute to overall health and potentially decrease the need for medical visits. Apples are a good source of fiber, vitamins, and antioxidants, which can benefit various aspects of health such as digestion, heart health, and immune function. However, while apples can be a healthy part of one's diet, relying solely on eating an apple a day to prevent all illnesses or medical conditions is an oversimplification.

{"id": 2747, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"One can become cleansed of all sins by means of knowledge alone.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"One can become cleansed of all sins by means of knowledge alone\" suggests that acquiring knowledge can lead to the absolution of sins. This idea may resonate with some philosophical or spiritual beliefs that emphasize the transformative power of enlightenment and understanding. However, in many cultural, religious, and ethical contexts, the cleansing of sins typically involves a combination of remorse, repentance, and corrective actions, not just the acquisition of knowledge. Knowledge can certainly contribute to recognizing one's mistakes and understanding the moral implications, but it is often the accompanying actions and changes in behavior that lead to redemption or cleansing.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 2748, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"One can choose to go back toward safety or forward toward growth growth must be chosen again and again fear must be overcome again and again.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that individuals have a choice between seeking comfort and security or embracing challenges and opportunities for personal growth. It implies that growth requires continuous effort and overcoming fear repeatedly. This idea aligns with common psychological and motivational theories that emphasize stepping out of one's comfort zone and facing fears as essential for personal development.

{"id": 2751, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"One man`s folly is often another man`s wife.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"One man's folly is often another man's wife\" is a play on words that suggests that what one person may consider a mistake or a poor decision, such as marrying a particular person, might be seen as a wise or desirable choice by someone else. It highlights the subjective nature of human perception and the differences in individual preferences and experiences. However, the statement can be seen as pejorative or dismissive of the complexities of relationships and the reasons why people choose their partners. It reduces the significance of marriage to a mere folly or mistake, which may not be an accurate or respectful depiction of the institution.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 2752, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"One must always hope when one is desperate and doubt when one hopes.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"One must always hope when one is desperate and doubt when one hopes\" suggests a cyclical process of maintaining hope in difficult situations and tempering expectations when hopeful. While hoping in desperation can be seen as a way to stay motivated and find solutions, the idea of doubting when hopeful may not be as straightforward. It can be interpreted as a strategy to remain cautious and realistic, preventing overconfidence and potential disappointment.\n\nHowever, this statement may not be universally applicable or seen as common sense, as different individuals may have varying approaches to handling hope and doubt based on their personal experiences, beliefs, and circumstances. \n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 2753, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"One must discard the prejudice that the truth must be something tangible.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that truth does not necessarily need to be something concrete or physical, and implies that truth can also be abstract or conceptual.

Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"One number added to another always creates a higher number\" is not necessarily common sense because it depends on the properties of the numbers involved. If both numbers are positive, then adding them together will indeed produce a higher number. However, if one or both of the numbers are negative, the result may not be higher. For example, adding -2 to 3 results in 1, which is not higher than 3, and adding -4 to -1 results in -5, which is lower than -1. Thus, the statement does not hold true in all scenarios involving addition of numbers.\n\nSo the answer is no."}

Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"One of the things you do when you sit down is bend your knees\" is generally reflective of a common physical action taken when sitting down. The act of sitting typically involves lowering the body onto a chair or similar surface, which naturally requires bending the knees to facilitate the motion. This is a basic biomechanical process that most people perform unconsciously as part of the act of sitting.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2758, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"One of the things you do when you sleep at night is snore.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"One of the things you do when you sleep at night is snore\" suggests that snoring is a common behavior for everyone during sleep. However, not everyone snores when they sleep. Snoring is caused by the relaxation of muscles in the throat and tongue, which can partially block the airway and produce the snoring sound as air passes through. Factors such as anatomy, weight, age, and certain health conditions can influence whether an individual snores. Therefore, the statement is not universally applicable to everyone. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 2759, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"One of the things you do when you snore is sleep.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"One of the things you do when you snore is sleep\" is based on the understanding that snoring is a noise produced during sleep due to the relaxation of respiratory structures and the resulting vibration of air as a person breathes. Since snoring can only occur when a person is asleep, it is logical to say that when a person snores, they are indeed sleeping. This is a straightforward observation about the nature of snoring and its relationship with sleep. Therefore, the statement can be considered common sense as it aligns with general knowledge about sleep behaviors. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2760, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"One of the things you do when you stay healthy is live longer.\" Do you think this statement is common sense?

Freedom of expression allows individuals to share their thoughts, ideas, and beliefs without fear of censorship or retaliation from the government. This freedom is essential for the functioning of a healthy and open society, where diverse viewpoints can be expressed and debated.\n\nHowever, this freedom is not absolute and may be subject to certain restrictions, particularly when the expression incites violence, spreads hate speech, or threatens public safety. In such cases, limited censorship might be necessary to maintain social harmony and protect the rights of others.\n\nDespite these exceptions, the general principle remains that sermons and speeches, as forms of expression, should be free from censorship in a free society to promote diversity of thought, encourage open dialogue, and uphold the democratic value of freedom of expression. \n\nSo the answer is yes."}

Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"Only a good for nothing is not interested in his past\" suggests that a person who does not care about their past lacks value or worth. However, this is a broad generalization and discounts various reasons why someone may choose not to dwell on their past, such as traumatic experiences or a focus on the present and future. Interest in one's past is not necessarily an indicator of one's value or character. People can be productive and lead fulfilling lives without a strong connection to their past. Therefore, it is not common sense to assume that only those who are \"good for nothing\" are uninterested in their past.\n\nSo the answer is no."}

Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that only those who are strong can engage in cooperation, while those who are weak have no option but to beg. This perspective is overly simplistic and overlooks the complexities of human relationships and interactions. Strength and weakness are not fixed attributes, and people can exhibit both qualities in different situations. Cooperation often involves a combination of strengths and weaknesses from all parties involved, and it can be a way for individuals to support each other's weaknesses. Additionally, labeling weakness as only capable of begging undermines the potential for growth and empowerment. Thus, the statement presents a limited and somewhat inaccurate view of human dynamics.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 2770, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"Opinioinated and hate involved news should not be the norm in society.\" Do you think this statement is common sense?

Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that many people fail to recognize opportunities because they require effort and hard work, which can be unappealing or intimidating. The metaphor of opportunity being \"dressed in overalls\" implies that it may not always be glamorous or immediately attractive. This idea aligns with the common understanding that success often requires dedication and perseverance, which can be overlooked by those seeking quick or easy gains.

Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"Peace on earth would mean the end of civilization as we know it\" suggests that conflict and struggle are inherent and necessary components of civilization. However, this perspective assumes that civilization cannot evolve or adapt to new, peaceful paradigms. While it is true that much of human history and civilization has been shaped by conflict, it does not necessarily mean that peace would end civilization. Instead, peace could lead to a transformation or evolution of civilization into new forms of social, economic, and political organization that do not rely on conflict. Thus, the idea that peace would end civilization is not necessarily common sense, as it overlooks the potential for positive change and adaptation. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 2802, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"Pelosi does not want to work with republicans.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"Pelosi does not want to work with republicans\" is not necessarily common sense, as it is a subjective and politically charged assertion. Common sense typically refers to widely held, practical, and sound judgments that are generally agreed upon. Political opinions and relationships, like the one described in the statement, can be complex and influenced by various factors. Such a statement might be an oversimplification of Pelosi's stance and interactions with Republicans, and without concrete evidence or context, it cannot be deemed common sense. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 2803, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"People acquire joy and satisfaction when they do well for themselves.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"People acquire joy and satisfaction when they do well for themselves\" is based on the idea that personal achievements and success contribute to an individual's happiness and self-fulfillment. This is a widely observed phenomenon as people generally feel a sense of pride and contentment when they reach their goals or excel in their endeavors, whether in their careers, personal projects, or other aspects of life. This sense of accomplishment can boost self-esteem and overall well-being.\n\nPsychological theories, such as Maslow's hierarchy of needs, also support this notion by suggesting that self-actualization, or the realization of one's potential, is crucial for achieving personal satisfaction. Additionally, positive reinforcement, which occurs when a behavior is rewarded, further encourages individuals to engage in actions that lead to success and personal gratification.\n\nGiven that this understanding aligns with common observations about human behavior and is supported by psychological principles, it can be considered a form of common sense. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2804, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"People adopt dogs because they have no children.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"People adopt dogs because they have no children\" is an oversimplification and generalization that does not account for the varied and multifaceted reasons why individuals or families might choose to adopt a dog. People adopt dogs for companionship, emotional support, exercise, or simply because they love animals, among other reasons. While it is possible that some people may adopt dogs as a substitute for children, it is not accurate to say that this is the sole or primary reason for all dog adoptions. Therefore, the statement does not represent common sense as it fails to consider the diversity of motivations behind dog adoption. \n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 2805, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"People are frustrated with their performance when they work well.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement, \"People are frustrated with their performance when they work well,\" does not align with common sense. Generally, people feel satisfied and accomplished when they perform well because their efforts lead to positive outcomes and success. Frustration is more commonly associated with poor performance or unmet expectations. Therefore, it is more logical to say that people are frustrated when they do not perform well, rather than when they excel in their tasks.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 2806, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"People are human.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"People are human\" is a fundamental truth that is widely understood and accepted. The term \"people\" inherently refers to human beings, making the statement a tautology or a self-evident truth. It is a basic concept that is commonly recognized and does not require further explanation or proof. Therefore, it is considered common sense. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2807, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"People are immature when they feel like kids.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"People are immature when they feel like kids\" suggests that feeling child-like equates to immaturity. However, feeling like a kid can encompass a range of positive qualities such as playfulness, curiosity, and open-mindedness, which are not necessarily signs of immaturity. Immaturity is generally characterized by a lack of emotional or intellectual development, irresponsibility, or an inability to handle serious situations effectively. Feeling child-like can be a healthy way for adults to connect with their sense of wonder and enjoyment, which is different from being immature. Therefore, the statement may oversimplify the concept of immaturity. \n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 2808, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"People are strange.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"People are strange\" is a subjective opinion and can vary depending on individual perspectives and experiences. It is not a universally accepted fact or a principle that can be easily proven or disproven. Additionally, the concept of \"strangeness\" is relative and can differ based on cultural, social, and personal contexts. Therefore, it may not be considered as common sense, which typically refers to widely held practical beliefs or basic knowledge shared among most people.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 2809, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"People are weird.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"People are weird\" is a subjective opinion based on individual perspectives and experiences. While some may find certain behaviors or characteristics of people to be odd or unusual, others may not perceive them in the same way. The concept of \"weirdness\" is relative and can vary greatly depending on cultural, social, and personal contexts. Therefore, it is difficult to categorize this statement as common sense, which generally refers to shared, practical knowledge or beliefs that are widely accepted by most people.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 2810, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"People become fitter when they start exercising.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"People become fitter when they start exercising\" is generally considered common sense because exercise is widely recognized as a key factor in improving physical fitness. Engaging in regular physical activity increases cardiovascular endurance, muscle strength, flexibility, and overall health. Exercise also helps in weight management and can prevent various health issues. Scientific studies and health experts consistently support the idea that exercise contributes positively to an individual's fitness level.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2811, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"People bleed if a car hits them.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"People bleed if a car hits them\" is generally based on the understanding that car accidents can cause physical injuries, and bleeding is a common result of such injuries. However, not all car accidents result in bleeding, as the severity and nature of the injuries can vary significantly. Additionally, the statement is overly simplistic and doesn't account for other possible outcomes in a car accident. Therefore, it cannot be universally accepted as common sense because it does not consider the variability in the outcomes of car accidents. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 2812, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"People break all the windows when they move into a new house.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"People break all the windows when they move into a new house\" does not align with common sense. When people move into a new house, they typically aim to maintain or improve the condition of the property. Breaking all the windows would be counterproductive, as it would create unnecessary costs for repairs and decrease the home's security and insulation. Therefore, this statement does not reflect a typical or reasonable action when moving into a new house.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 2813, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"People can act normally and make no sense.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"People can act normally and make no sense\" suggests that an individual's behavior may appear typical or conforming to societal norms, but their actions or words may still be illogical or difficult to understand. This can occur due to various reasons such as miscommunication, differing perspectives, or even underlying mental health issues that aren't outwardly visible. In daily life, it's common to encounter situations where someone's actions might seem normal but their reasoning or explanations are confusing or unclear. Thus, this statement reflects a realistic aspect of human behavior and interaction. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2814, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"People can be cruel.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"People can be cruel\" is a reflection of a common observation in human behavior. Throughout history and in various contexts, individuals have demonstrated the capacity for cruelty in actions and words, whether on a small scale in interpersonal relationships or on a large scale in events such as wars or genocides. This observation is widely acknowledged and understood across different cultures and societies. It is also supported by psychological and sociological studies that analyze negative human behaviors and their impacts. Thus, the statement is based on a widely recognized aspect of human nature.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2815, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"People can be kind.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"People can be kind\" is generally considered common sense because it is a widely observed and accepted notion that humans have the capacity for kindness. Throughout various cultures and societies, acts of kindness are encouraged and often seen as a positive trait. Furthermore, most people have experienced or witnessed kindness in their lives, reinforcing the idea that people can indeed be kind. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2816, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"People can be stupid.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"People can be stupid\" is a subjective opinion that reflects the idea that individuals can sometimes make poor or irrational decisions. It is a common observation that everyone, at some point, may act in a way that is not well-thought-out or sensible. This statement could be considered common sense as it acknowledges the imperfections and limitations in human judgment and behavior that are widely recognized and understood. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2817, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"People can feel a little hot when it is winter.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"People can feel a little hot when it is winter\" could be considered common sense depending on the context. During winter, people often wear layers of clothing and use heating systems to stay warm. In certain situations, such as being in a heated indoor environment or engaging in physical activity, people might feel hot despite the cold outdoor temperatures. Additionally, individual differences in metabolism and body temperature regulation can also lead to some people feeling warmer than others. Therefore, the statement reflects a plausible scenario.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2818, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"People can have a bird as a pet when they catch it.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"People can have a bird as a pet when they catch it\" may not be common sense. While it is possible for some people to catch a wild bird and keep it as a pet, it is generally not advisable or ethical without proper knowledge and permits. Wild birds are not accustomed to living in captivity and may not thrive in a domestic environment. Additionally, there are legal considerations and regulations in many places that protect wild birds and prevent them from being captured and kept as pets. It is more common and sensible to acquire a pet bird through legal and ethical means, such as purchasing from a reputable breeder or adopting from a rescue organization. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 2819, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"People can pretend to be cold.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"People can pretend to be cold\" refers to the ability of individuals to feign feeling physically cold, even when they are not actually experiencing low temperatures. This could be done for various reasons, such as to elicit sympathy or to avoid certain activities. Given that people are capable of pretending various emotions and physical states, it is reasonable to assume that pretending to be cold is also within the realm of possibility. Therefore, the statement aligns with common sense as it acknowledges the human capacity for pretense.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2820, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"People can think.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"People can think\" is generally considered common sense because it reflects a basic understanding of human nature and cognition. Humans are known to possess the capacity for thought, which includes processing information, making decisions, and solving problems. This ability to think is what sets humans apart from most other species and is fundamental to daily functioning and survival.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2821, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"People can throw their tickets away when they get on empty train.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that it's acceptable to discard tickets when boarding an empty train, but this is not aligned with common sense. Tickets serve as proof of payment for the journey, regardless of how full or empty the train is. Throwing away tickets could lead to issues such as being unable to show a valid ticket during an inspection, which can result in penalties or fines. Therefore, it's important to keep tickets until the end of the journey as they are required for the entirety of the trip. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 2822, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"People cannot sing at work when they have a great boss.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"People cannot sing at work when they have a great boss\" is not necessarily a matter of common sense, as it involves subjective elements and assumptions about workplace culture and individual behavior. Whether or not people can sing at work depends on various factors, such as the nature of the job, the workplace environment, and the policies set by the employer. A great boss could potentially encourage a more relaxed and creative atmosphere where singing is allowed, or they might maintain a more traditional and quiet work environment. Therefore, it is not a straightforward conclusion that having a great boss would prohibit singing at work. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 2823, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"People change their style and outfits when they want a new look.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"People change their style and outfits when they want a new look\" is based on the general understanding that individuals often seek visual or aesthetic changes to refresh or reinvent their appearance. Changing style and outfits is one of the most direct and effective ways to achieve a noticeable difference in one's appearance. This practice is commonly observed in various cultures and societies as a way to mark new beginnings or to express different aspects of one's personality or mood. It is also supported by the fashion industry, which continually promotes new trends and styles to cater to this desire for change.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2824, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"People do the opposite of what the sign says when they see it.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"People do the opposite of what the sign says when they see it\" is not necessarily common sense. Common sense suggests that signs are generally put up to guide, warn, or instruct people to behave in a certain way that is considered safe or appropriate. Most individuals tend to follow the instructions on signs as they understand the purpose behind them, such as traffic signs that ensure safety and order on the roads. While there might be exceptions where individuals intentionally disobey signs, this behavior is not the norm and therefore does not align with common sense. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 2825, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"People don't clean their shoes after they accidentally step in dog poop.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"People don't clean their shoes after they accidentally step in dog poop\" is not necessarily common sense. Common sense would suggest that people would want to clean their shoes to remove the unpleasant odor and residue. It is generally accepted that maintaining cleanliness and hygiene is important, and stepping in dog poop would prompt most individuals to clean their shoes to avoid tracking the mess elsewhere and to keep their shoes in good condition.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 2826, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"People don't feel good when they get full.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"People don't feel good when they get full\" refers to the discomfort that can arise from overeating, such as bloating, stomach pain, and lethargy. It is common knowledge that consuming food beyond one's capacity can lead to physical discomfort, which is generally an unpleasant experience. This understanding is widely recognized and shared among people, making it a matter of common sense that overeating can result in feeling unwell. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2827, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"People don't look on the highway before changing lanes.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"People don't look on the highway before changing lanes\" is not necessarily common sense. Common sense suggests that drivers should check their mirrors and blind spots for safety reasons before changing lanes to avoid accidents. While some individuals may neglect to do so, it is generally expected and taught in driving education that one should look before changing lanes. Therefore, the statement does not align with what is widely considered to be common sense in terms of safe driving practices.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 2828, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"People don't want more food when they get full.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"People don't want more food when they get full\" is based on the physiological response of the human body to satiety. When a person eats, their stomach expands and signals are sent to the brain indicating fullness. This feeling of satiety naturally decreases the desire to continue eating. Therefore, it is reasonable to say that once a person feels full, their appetite for more food declines. This is a general observation and common understanding among people regarding eating behavior. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2829, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"People exhale carbon dioxide whereas plants exhale oxygen.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"People exhale carbon dioxide whereas plants exhale oxygen\" is not entirely accurate in its wording but captures the general idea of the biological processes involved. People do exhale carbon dioxide as a byproduct of respiration, during which oxygen is taken in and used to produce energy, releasing carbon dioxide. On the other hand, plants release oxygen as a byproduct of photosynthesis, a process in which they use sunlight, carbon dioxide, and water to produce glucose and oxygen. However, the use of the term \"exhale\" for plants is misleading as plants do not have respiratory systems like animals; they release oxygen through small pores called stomata primarily during the day. Despite this slight inaccuracy in terminology, the underlying concept that humans release carbon dioxide and plants release oxygen (contributing to a natural balance) is generally understood and aligns with common scientific knowledge. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2830, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"People expect viewers when they upload videos on the internet.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"People expect viewers when they upload videos on the internet\" is generally founded on the premise that individuals create and share content online with the intention of it being seen by others. Uploading videos to platforms like YouTube, Vimeo, or social media sites inherently involves making content public or sharing it with specific people. The motivation behind sharing videos often includes seeking engagement, feedback, or simply sharing experiences or information with others. Therefore, it is logical to assume that people expect viewers when they upload videos, as the primary function of video-sharing platforms is to disseminate content to an audience. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2831, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"People fail when they try too fast.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"People fail when they try too fast\" suggests that rushing through tasks or endeavors without proper planning, preparation, or consideration can lead to failure. This aligns with the common understanding that haste can lead to mistakes and oversights. In many areas of life, such as learning new skills, building relationships, or working on complex projects, taking the necessary time to proceed carefully and thoughtfully can increase the chances of success. Therefore, the idea that trying too fast can result in failure resonates with the general wisdom that patience and diligence are important for achieving desired outcomes.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2832, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"People fear silence as they fear solitude because both give them a glimpse of the terror of life`s nothingness.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that people fear silence and solitude because they expose the emptiness or meaninglessness of life. This perspective aligns with existential philosophy, which posits that confronting the inherent meaninglessness of life can lead to feelings of anxiety and dread. However, whether this statement is considered common sense depends on individual beliefs and cultural perspectives. Some people might find solace and peace in silence and solitude, viewing them as opportunities for introspection and personal growth rather than sources of fear. Therefore, the statement may not be universally accepted as common sense. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 2833, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"People feel depressed when they dig themselves into a hole.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"People feel depressed when they dig themselves into a hole\" is often understood metaphorically, suggesting that when individuals find themselves in difficult or overwhelming situations, it can lead to feelings of depression or distress. It is common for people to feel a sense of helplessness or hopelessness when they perceive their problems as insurmountable, which can contribute to negative emotional states. This aligns with psychological understanding that environmental stressors and feelings of being overwhelmed can impact mental health. Therefore, this statement reflects a commonly recognized concept about the relationship between challenging circumstances and emotional well-being. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2834, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"People feel embarassed when they lose face.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"People feel embarrassed when they lose face\" refers to the emotional response of feeling ashamed or humiliated when one's public image or reputation is damaged. Losing face can be a distressing experience for many individuals, as it can lead to a decrease in social standing and respect from others. Since embarrassment is a common emotional reaction to situations where one's self-esteem or dignity is threatened, it aligns with the natural human desire to maintain a positive public image and be respected by others. Therefore, it is reasonable to consider this statement as aligning with common sense.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2835, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"People feel entertained when they enjoy a trip.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"People feel entertained when they enjoy a trip\" is based on the idea that entertainment is derived from enjoyable experiences. Trips often involve exploring new places, engaging in fun activities, and taking a break from routine, all of which can contribute to a sense of enjoyment. When people enjoy these aspects of a trip, they are likely to feel entertained as they are positively engaged and stimulated by the experience. Therefore, it is reasonable to consider that enjoyment during a trip leads to a feeling of being entertained.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2836, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"People feel happy when others take advantage of them.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"People feel happy when others take advantage of them\" does not align with common sense. Generally, when people are taken advantage of, they feel exploited, disrespected, or hurt. These feelings are contrary to happiness. Happiness is typically associated with positive experiences, mutual respect, and equitable treatment. Being taken advantage of often leads to negative emotions and a sense of betrayal, which are inconsistent with happiness. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 2837, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"People feel happy when they bring a house down.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"People feel happy when they bring a house down\" can be interpreted in two ways: literally demolishing a house or metaphorically receiving enthusiastic applause or approval in a performance setting. If interpreted literally, it's not common sense to say people generally feel happy about demolishing a house, as this could involve loss or destruction. However, if interpreted metaphorically as succeeding in a performance or event, it could be common sense that people feel happy when they receive overwhelming approval or applause, equated to \"bringing the house down.\" Since the statement is ambiguous and could be misleading if taken literally, it is not common sense without context.\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 2838, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"People feel hungry when they eat all the food they have.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"People feel hungry when they eat all the food they have\" seems counterintuitive as it suggests that consuming all available food leads to hunger, whereas typically eating food satisfies hunger. Generally, people feel hungry when they haven't eaten enough or when it has been a while since their last meal. Therefore, the statement contradicts the usual understanding of how hunger works in relation to eating. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 2839, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"People feel lost when they are in trouble.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"People feel lost when they are in trouble\" suggests that individuals may experience feelings of confusion, uncertainty, or lack of direction during challenging situations. This is a common psychological response as trouble or difficulties can disrupt one's usual sense of stability and control. When facing problems, people might struggle to find solutions or make decisions, which can contribute to feeling lost. Given that this is a typical human reaction to adversity, the statement aligns with general understanding and observations of human behavior in difficult circumstances. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2840, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"People feel relieved when they are in a lot of trouble.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"People feel relieved when they are in a lot of trouble\" seems counterintuitive to common sense. Generally, when people are in a lot of trouble, they experience feelings of stress, anxiety, or fear rather than relief. Relief is typically felt when a burden is lifted or a problem is resolved, not when one is in the midst of trouble. Therefore, it does not align with common sense to say that people feel relieved when facing significant difficulties.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 2841, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"People flying disconcerting signs should be decent about it.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that individuals displaying unsettling or provocative signs should do so respectfully and considerately. Common sense dictates that any form of communication, especially one that could potentially be disturbing or controversial, should be approached with a level of decency and respect for others. This helps maintain public order and promotes constructive dialogue.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2842, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"People generally quarrel because they cannot argue.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that people resort to quarreling when they lack the ability to engage in reasoned argumentation. This implies that the inability to articulate thoughts, opinions, and viewpoints in a logical and structured manner can lead to frustration and emotional outbursts, which manifest as quarrels. It's a common observation that when individuals are unable to convincingly communicate their ideas or convince others through reasoning, they might become defensive or aggressive, leading to quarrels. This perspective aligns with the idea that effective communication and argumentation skills can help prevent unnecessary conflicts and promote understanding. Therefore, the statement highlights a plausible psychological and social dynamic.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2843, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"People get away when they are able to escape.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"People get away when they are able to escape\" seems to express a straightforward idea that is generally understood and accepted. The concept of \"getting away\" inherently implies that someone has successfully escaped from a situation or location. Therefore, the ability to escape is a prerequisite for getting away. This statement aligns with common sense as it describes a logical sequence of events that is easily comprehensible. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2844, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"People get very drunk when they get on a crowded train.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"People get very drunk when they get on a crowded train\" is not common sense because there is no inherent connection between being on a crowded train and consuming alcohol. People's decision to drink alcohol is influenced by various factors such as personal choice, social settings, or events, not merely the crowdedness of a train. The crowdedness of a train might lead to discomfort or stress, but it does not directly cause people to become drunk.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 2845, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"People get wet when they feel hot.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"People get wet when they feel hot\" is not necessarily common sense as it lacks clarity and context. The phrase \"get wet\" could imply sweating due to the body's natural cooling mechanism when overheated, or it could mean intentionally getting wet by swimming or taking a shower to cool off. Without specifying the mechanism, the statement is too ambiguous to be considered common sense. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 2846, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"People go somewhere else when they decide to leave.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"People go somewhere else when they decide to leave\" implies that when individuals decide to leave a particular location, they move to a different location. This is a logical and straightforward observation, as leaving inherently involves vacating one place and relocating to another, whether it's moving to a different room, building, city, or country. It reflects a basic understanding of physical movement and displacement. Therefore, it can be considered common sense, as it aligns with general knowledge and everyday experience.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2847, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"People go to dairy queen when they want ice cream.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"People go to Dairy Queen when they want ice cream\" is based on the idea that Dairy Queen is a popular and well-known ice cream chain. It suggests that when people have a craving for ice cream, Dairy Queen is a common destination because it offers a variety of ice cream products. However, it's important to note that this is not universally true as people have different preferences and might choose other ice cream shops or options available to them. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 2848, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"People go to sleep when they have a high fever.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"People go to sleep when they have a high fever\" is not necessarily common sense, as it suggests a specific behavior in response to a medical condition that may not apply universally. While sleep can help the body recover and the immune system fight off infection, not everyone with a high fever may be able to sleep due to discomfort, pain, or other symptoms. Additionally, some might need medical attention instead of sleep depending on the severity of the fever. Therefore, the statement oversimplifies the varied responses individuals might have when experiencing a high fever. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 2849, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"People hang their head when they feel badly.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"People hang their head when they feel badly\" is generally considered to be common sense because it refers to a common body language cue that people exhibit when experiencing negative emotions such as sadness, shame, or disappointment. Hanging the head is a non-verbal way of expressing these feelings, and it is widely recognized across different cultures. This behavior can be observed in everyday life and is often depicted in media and literature as well. Therefore, it aligns with what is typically understood and expected in social interactions when someone is feeling down.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2850, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"People hate going to work when they have a great boss.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"People hate going to work when they have a great boss\" is not common sense because generally, having a great boss tends to make the work environment more enjoyable and motivating. A good leader positively impacts job satisfaction and employee morale, which usually makes people more eager to go to work. Therefore, it would be counterintuitive to suggest that people hate going to work when they have a great boss. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 2851, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"People have a constitutional right to protest.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"People have a constitutional right to protest\" is based on the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, which guarantees the right to freedom of speech, freedom of assembly, and the right to petition the government for a redress of grievances. These rights are fundamental to a democratic society as they allow individuals to express their opinions and seek changes in government policies. Protesting is a form of exercising these freedoms and is protected under the constitution. Therefore, it is common sense that people have a constitutional right to protest as it is explicitly supported by the foundational legal document of the United States.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2852, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"People have abused one another across time and space and explains why differences we see today are not necessarily evidence of unique malfeasance.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that the mistreatment and abuse among people is a universal and historical phenomenon, not limited to a specific time, place, or group. It implies that the differences in how people are treated today shouldn't be seen as evidence of exceptional wrongdoing, but rather as part of a broader, ongoing pattern of human behavior. This perspective can help to contextualize current events within the larger scope of human history, reminding us that many issues are deeply rooted and not isolated cases. By understanding this, we might approach problems with a more informed and nuanced perspective. \n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2853, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"People have no one to play with when they adopt a dog.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"People have no one to play with when they adopt a dog\" does not align with common sense. When someone adopts a dog, they gain a companion and a playmate. Dogs are known for their playful and social nature, providing their owners with opportunities for interaction and activity. The statement contradicts the widely recognized benefit of pet ownership, which includes companionship and increased opportunities for socialization and play. Therefore, adopting a dog typically means having a new friend to play and spend time with. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 2854, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"People have to get the trap ready when they set it.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"People have to get the trap ready when they set it\" is essentially stating that preparation is necessary before setting a trap. This is a logical and straightforward assertion because a trap would not be functional or effective if it were not properly prepared or set up beforehand. It's a fundamental step in the process of setting a trap to ensure it works as intended. Therefore, it can be considered common sense to prepare a trap before setting it. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2855, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"People hold parties when they get a raise.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"People hold parties when they get a raise\" is based on the general idea that individuals may celebrate positive events in their lives. Getting a raise is a common reason for celebration as it represents recognition of hard work and often brings financial relief or joy. However, whether or not people hold parties to celebrate a raise can vary greatly depending on individual preferences, cultural norms, financial situations, and personal circumstances. Not everyone may choose to hold a party; some might prefer a more subdued form of celebration or might not celebrate at all. Therefore, while the statement could be true for some, it is not universally applicable to everyone. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 2856, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"People jump right in when they call upon to perform.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"People jump right in when they are called upon to perform\" implies that individuals are always ready and willing to take immediate action when asked to perform a task or duty. However, this may not always be the case as people's readiness and willingness can vary based on factors such as their confidence, skill level, experience, and the context in which they are being asked to perform. Some individuals may hesitate or feel unprepared, while others might indeed jump right in with enthusiasm. Therefore, the statement cannot be universally applied as common sense, as it does not account for the diverse range of human behaviors and reactions in different situations.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 2857, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"People lash out at everyone when they get fed up.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"People lash out at everyone when they get fed up\" is a generalization and may not be true for everyone. People react differently to stress and frustration based on their personality, coping mechanisms, and emotional intelligence. Some people might lash out, while others may withdraw or seek constructive ways to deal with their feelings. Therefore, the statement does not universally apply to all individuals. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 2858, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"People laugh at themselves when they finish projects.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"People laugh at themselves when they finish projects\" is not necessarily common sense. People may have different reactions upon completing projects, and laughter is not a universal response. Reactions can vary based on the nature of the project, the level of stress involved, the outcome, and the individual's personality. Some may feel relieved, accomplished, or even exhausted, rather than finding humor in the situation. Therefore, it is not accurate to generalize that people laugh at themselves when they finish projects as a common response.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 2859, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"People leave their bags open on crowded trains.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"People leave their bags open on crowded trains\" does not align with common sense. Typically, in crowded settings, individuals are more vigilant about their belongings to prevent theft or loss. With an increase in the number of people around, the risk of someone taking items from an open bag becomes higher. Therefore, it is more likely that people would keep their bags closed and secure to protect their possessions. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 2860, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"People look for glue and sparkles but no pencil when they want to write a story.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that people prioritize elements that enhance creativity and presentation (glue and sparkles) over the basic tool needed for writing (a pencil). In reality, when writing a story, the essential tool is a writing instrument, such as a pencil or pen. The glue and sparkles might be used for decorative purposes but are not fundamental for the act of writing itself. Therefore, the statement contradicts common sense as it overlooks the primary necessity for writing. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 2861, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"People make mistakes when they work.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"People make mistakes when they work\" reflects a common understanding that humans are not infallible and errors can occur in any task or job. It acknowledges that mistakes are a natural part of the learning and working process, regardless of one's expertise or experience level. Considering that no one is perfect and errors are often inevitable in various situations, this statement aligns with a general perception of human behavior and capability. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2862, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"People memorize results instead of writing them down after doing research.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that people rely on memory rather than documenting their findings after conducting research. In practice, it is generally advisable to write down or record research results to ensure accuracy, facilitate further analysis, and provide a reliable reference for future use.

This behavior is a common and understandable reaction to maintain a comfortable and safe body temperature. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2865, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"People need good lies there are too many bad ones.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"People need good lies there are too many bad ones\" suggests that lies can be categorized as either good or bad and that good lies might be necessary or beneficial in certain situations. This could be referring to the idea of telling white lies or lies that protect someone's feelings or maintain social harmony. However, the notion of needing lies, whether good or bad, can be subjective and context-dependent. Some people might argue that honesty is always the best policy and that lies, even well-intentioned ones, can lead to mistrust or misunderstanding. Others might see the value in telling harmless or protective lies in specific circumstances. \n\nUltimately, whether this statement is considered common sense depends on one's personal beliefs and values about honesty and deception. Since opinions on this can vary widely, it might not be universally regarded as common sense. \n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 2866, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"People need some iced tea when they feel a little cold.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"People need some iced tea when they feel a little cold\" does not align with common sense, as iced tea is a cold beverage typically consumed to cool down rather than warm up. When people feel cold, they generally seek out warm beverages like hot tea or coffee to help raise their body temperature. Therefore, the idea of needing iced tea when feeling cold contradicts typical behavior and common practices for dealing with cold sensations.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 2867, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"People need to be united to stop covid.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"People need to be united to stop covid\" is based on the idea that collective action and cooperation are essential in controlling the spread of the virus. Public health measures such as wearing masks, practicing social distancing, and getting vaccinated are more effective when a large majority of the population adheres to them.

Therefore, the statement reflects a common sense approach to addressing a global pandemic.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2868, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"People need to put seatbelt on when they drive home from school.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"People need to put seatbelt on when they drive home from school\" is based on the widely accepted practice of wearing seatbelts for safety while driving a vehicle. Seatbelts are proven to reduce the risk of injury and death in the event of a car accident.

Additionally, the desire to improve grades or achieve specific academic goals often motivates people to invest in tutoring services. Therefore, the statement aligns with typical behavior when faced with academic difficulties.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2870, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"People often make imperfect things even if they think things are perfect.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that despite people's intentions or beliefs, imperfections are an inherent part of human creation. This aligns with the common understanding that no human effort or creation can achieve absolute perfection due to limitations in knowledge, skills, and resources. Everyone has different standards and perceptions of what \"perfect\" is, and what may seem perfect to one person might not be to another. Moreover, mistakes and imperfections are natural aspects of the human experience and the learning process. Thus, this statement reflects a basic truth about human nature and the nature of our endeavors.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2871, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"People often poke fish with their fingers when they feed it.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"People often poke fish with their fingers when they feed it\" is not common sense. Generally, when feeding fish, people are cautioned to avoid touching or poking the fish as it can cause stress or harm to the fish. Instead, food is typically sprinkled into the water or placed gently using tools or feeding devices designed for aquariums or fish habitats. Poking fish with fingers is not a recommended or typical practice when feeding them. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 2872, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"People on empty train stand up instead of sitting.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"People on empty train stand up instead of sitting\" seems counterintuitive as common sense suggests that when there are plenty of seats available on an empty train, people would generally prefer to sit down and relax during their journey. Standing up when there are many available seats would be less comfortable and less practical. Therefore, this statement does not align with typical behavior or common sense expectations in such a scenario.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 2873, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"People on power should fight for peoples right.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"People in power should fight for people's rights\" aligns with the idea that those who hold positions of authority and influence have a responsibility to advocate for and protect the rights and well-being of the individuals they serve. This is based on the ethical principle of justice and the social contract theory, which suggests that leaders are entrusted with power in exchange for their commitment to the common good.

{"id": 2874, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"People open a window when they feel hot.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"People open a window when they feel hot\" is based on the general understanding that opening a window allows for increased ventilation and air circulation, which can help cool down a room and provide relief from heat.

Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"People quit their job if they have a great boss\" does not align with common sense because generally, having a great boss is considered a positive aspect of a job. A great boss can contribute positively to the work environment, provide support, and motivate employees to perform better. These factors typically lead to higher job satisfaction and employee retention. Research and surveys often suggest that people are more likely to leave their jobs due to poor management, lack of growth opportunities, or unsatisfactory working conditions. Therefore, the statement contradicts the typical reasons why people might choose to leave a job.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 2876, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"People scream in pain after they work their fingers to the bones.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"People scream in pain after they work their fingers to the bone\" is a figurative way of saying that people experience significant discomfort or pain after excessive or strenuous physical labor, particularly involving their hands. In reality, while people may not literally scream, they can certainly experience pain or fatigue after intense work. This expression emphasizes the severity of the physical toll. Thus, while the statement might not be literally true in terms of the action of screaming, it makes sense in conveying the idea of intense pain or fatigue following hard work. So the answer is yes."}

{"id": 2879, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"People should be wary of the long term effects of covid 19.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"People should be wary of the long-term effects of COVID-19\" is based on the understanding that COVID-19 is a novel virus, and research is still ongoing to fully comprehend its long-term health impacts.

These symptoms can include fatigue, shortness of breath, cognitive impairments, and other health issues that may persist for months. Given the potential for serious and prolonged health consequences, it is reasonable to advise caution and awareness regarding the long-term effects of the virus. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2880, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"People should clean up trash after discharging fireworks.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"People should clean up trash after discharging fireworks\" emphasizes the importance of being responsible and considerate of the environment and community.

{"id": 2881, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"People should elect a new governor who would let parents of college athletes attend the game.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"People should elect a new governor who would let parents of college athletes attend the game\" is not necessarily common sense, as it addresses a very specific issue and assumes that the current governor is preventing parents from attending games, which may not be the case. The decision on whether parents can attend college games often depends on broader factors such as public health guidelines, university policies, and logistical considerations, rather than solely on the governor's preferences. Electing a governor based solely on this specific issue might not address other important governance aspects that impact the state. Therefore, it is not common sense to focus on this singular issue when considering a candidate for governor. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 2882, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"People should join the dnc national convention to celebrate the democratic nominee for president.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"People should join the DNC National Convention to celebrate the democratic nominee for president\" assumes that individuals support the Democratic party and its nominee. It may not be common sense for individuals who have different political affiliations or who do not agree with the policies of the Democratic party. Additionally, attending a national convention may not be feasible for everyone due to logistical, financial, or personal reasons. Therefore, the statement may not be universally applicable or agreed upon as common sense.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 2883, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"People should neuter dogs they adopt from the street.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "Neutering dogs adopted from the street is generally considered a responsible action to prevent overpopulation and reduce the number of stray dogs. It also has health benefits for the dogs, such as reducing the risk of certain cancers and diseases.

Given these benefits, the statement aligns with common practices and recommendations in animal welfare.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2884, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"People should not be allowed to own assault rifles or large caches of ammunition.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"People should not be allowed to own assault rifles or large caches of ammunition\" can be considered common sense from a public safety perspective. Assault rifles are high-powered firearms designed for military use and have the capability to cause mass casualties, which may not be necessary for civilian self-defense or recreational use. Large caches of ammunition can also pose a risk if they fall into the wrong hands or are used with malicious intent. Restricting access to these items could potentially reduce the likelihood of mass shootings and increase overall public safety. So the answer is yes."}

Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"People should not support Katie Porter and boycott media that support that person\" is subjective and based on individual opinions and perspectives. Whether or not it is considered common sense depends on one's political views, personal values, and information about Katie Porter. Common sense typically refers to practical and sound judgment, and in the context of political support, it varies greatly among individuals. Therefore, determining if boycotting Katie Porter and associated media is common sense is not universally applicable and differs from person to person.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 2886, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"People should only discharge fireworks on private property.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that fireworks should be discharged only on private property to ensure safety and minimize disturbance to others. Discharging fireworks in public spaces can pose risks to bystanders and create noise and environmental pollution that could affect the wider community. By keeping fireworks to private property, it is easier to control the environment and ensure that safety measures are in place, reducing the likelihood of accidents or unintended consequences. Additionally, it respects the rights and peace of others who may not wish to be exposed to fireworks. Therefore, this guideline helps promote both safety and consideration for others.

Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"People should only hug each other in limited circumstances\" can be seen in different ways depending on cultural, personal, and situational contexts. In some cultures, hugging is a common and acceptable form of greeting or showing affection, while in others, it may be reserved for close relationships or specific occasions. Additionally, personal comfort levels with physical touch can vary widely among individuals.

Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"People should stay home or use extreme caution outside during a storm\" is based on the potential dangers that storms can pose. Storms can bring strong winds, heavy rain, lightning, and other hazardous conditions that can jeopardize personal safety. Staying home minimizes the risk of accidents or injuries that could occur from being outside in such conditions. Alternatively, if it is necessary to be outside, using extreme caution can help mitigate those risks. So the answer is yes."}

Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"People should support the NYPD\" can be seen as a matter of personal opinion and perspective. Support for law enforcement can vary depending on individual experiences, community relations, and views on policing policies.

Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"People sit down and write when they want to write a story\" is generally considered common sense because writing typically involves a physical act of sitting down at a desk or table with writing tools such as a pen and paper or a computer. This physical posture provides the necessary stability and focus required for the cognitive task of composing a story. Additionally, the act of sitting down signifies a deliberate intention to dedicate time and attention to the writing process.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}

Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"People spend their days relaxing when they stay home\" is not universally true as it assumes a singular activity for everyone staying home. In reality, people engage in a variety of activities when they are at home, which can include working, studying, doing chores, taking care of children, or engaging in hobbies, in addition to relaxing. The experience of staying home can vary greatly depending on individual circumstances and responsibilities. So the answer is no."}

Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"People starve when they make sandwiches\" does not align with common sense. Generally, making sandwiches is associated with preparing food to eat, which would help alleviate hunger rather than cause starvation. The statement seems to contradict the typical understanding of preparing and consuming food. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 2895, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"People stay awake the day before they have night shifts.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"People stay awake the day before they have night shifts\" is not necessarily common sense, as it varies depending on individual habits and circumstances.

The decision to stay awake or not can depend on personal sleep patterns, the nature of the job, and other factors. Therefore, it is not a universally applicable or obvious practice.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 2896, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"People stay dry when they splash in the water.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"People stay dry when they splash in the water\" contradicts common sense and basic understanding of how water interacts with people. Typically, when people splash in water, they get wet as the water makes contact with their skin and clothing. This is a basic physical occurrence that happens due to the properties of water. Therefore, the statement that people stay dry while splashing in water is not aligned with common sense or reality.\n\nSo the answer is no."}

When individuals recognize and capitalize on these opportunities, they are more likely to achieve their goals and succeed in their endeavors. This concept aligns with the general understanding that being proactive and responsive to favorable circumstances can lead to positive outcomes.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2898, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"People throw massive parties when they move into a new house.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"People throw massive parties when they move into a new house\" is not necessarily common sense, as the behavior of throwing massive parties when moving into a new house can vary greatly depending on cultural, social, and personal factors. Some people may choose to throw large parties to celebrate their new home, while others may prefer smaller gatherings or no celebration at all. Additionally, financial constraints, space limitations, and individual preferences can all influence whether or not someone decides to host a massive party upon moving into a new house. Therefore, it cannot be universally assumed as common sense that people throw massive parties when they move into a new house. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 2899, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"People turn off the lights in the room when they leave it.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"People turn off the lights in the room when they leave it\" is generally considered common sense because it aligns with the typical behavior of conserving energy and reducing electricity costs.

Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that having a great boss can positively influence the work environment and relationships among coworkers. A great boss typically fosters a supportive and respectful atmosphere, which can lead to better collaboration and appreciation among team members. When employees feel valued and supported by their leadership, it can enhance their overall job satisfaction and their perception of their colleagues. Therefore, it makes sense that people usually appreciate their coworkers more when they have a great boss, as the positive work culture set by the boss can trickle down to employee interactions.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2901, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"People usually escape quietly.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"People usually escape quietly\" is context-dependent and may not always hold true. In some situations, such as escaping a dangerous situation, people may indeed try to be quiet to avoid detection. However, in other scenarios, like escaping a mundane or non-threatening situation, people may not necessarily be quiet. Additionally, the method of escape can vary greatly depending on the circumstances and the environment. Therefore, the statement cannot be universally accepted as common sense because it does not apply to all situations involving escape. So the answer is no."}

Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"People usually know how to correctly change a baby's diaper when they do it\" may not necessarily be common sense for everyone. Changing a baby's diaper correctly involves specific knowledge and skills that one may acquire through experience, guidance, or instruction. Not everyone may inherently know how to do this task properly without being taught or having prior experience, such as first-time parents or caregivers. Additionally, factors such as the type of diaper being used (cloth vs. disposable) can also influence the process. Therefore, assuming that everyone knows how to do it correctly without any prior knowledge or experience may not be accurate. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 2904, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"People usually play with medicine when they take some.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"People usually play with medicine when they take some\" does not align with common sense.

{"id": 2905, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"People usually sit on the couch when they watch their favourite movie.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"People usually sit on the couch when they watch their favorite movie\" is based on the general understanding that couches provide a comfortable seating option for extended periods, such as watching a movie. Most living rooms are equipped with couches positioned for optimal viewing of the television or entertainment system. It is common practice for people to seek comfort while engaging in leisure activities such as movie watching, and couches are designed to offer such comfort. Additionally, watching a movie is often a shared experience, and couches facilitate group seating. Therefore, it is sensible to assume that people usually sit on the couch when watching their favorite movie. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2906, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"People usually think logically on what to do.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"People usually think logically on what to do\" assumes that individuals generally approach decision-making using logical reasoning. While it is true that many people strive to make logical and rational choices, human behavior is also influenced by emotions, biases, past experiences, and other factors that may not always align with purely logical thinking. Therefore, the statement might not accurately reflect the complexity of human decision-making processes.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 2907, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"People usually try to complete their work satisfactory.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"People usually try to complete their work satisfactorily\" speaks to the general human behavior of striving to meet expectations and fulfill responsibilities in a manner that is deemed acceptable or good. Most individuals aim to perform their tasks well to achieve personal satisfaction, meet job requirements, or maintain a positive reputation.

{"id": 2909, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"People usually try to shop around for the best price and negotiate when going car shopping.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement that people usually try to shop around for the best price and negotiate when going car shopping reflects a common behavior observed in consumers seeking to make a significant purchase. Car shopping involves a considerable financial investment, and most consumers aim to find the most cost-effective option to maximize their value for money. Negotiating the price is a typical practice in car purchases since dealers often have flexibility in pricing, and consumers aim to leverage this to secure the best possible deal. Therefore, the statement aligns with general consumer behavior in the context of car shopping.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2910, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"People usually wear pants on their arms.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"People usually wear pants on their arms\" is not aligned with common sense because pants are typically designed to be worn on the legs, not the arms. Pants are made to fit around the waist and legs, providing coverage and comfort for the lower part of the body. Arms are usually covered by shirts, jackets, or other upper-body garments. Therefore, it is not common for people to wear pants on their arms. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 2911, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"People want to repent when they lose their character.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"People want to repent when they lose their character\" implies that individuals feel remorse or a desire to make amends when they engage in actions that compromise their integrity or moral values. It is possible that when someone's actions contradict their personal ethics or societal norms, they may experience guilt or regret, prompting a desire to seek forgiveness or redemption. However, this statement might not be universally true as people's responses to losing their character can vary greatly depending on their personal beliefs, cultural background, and the specific circumstances involved.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 2912, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"People wear sleavless clothes when they feel cold.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"People wear sleeveless clothes when they feel cold\" is not in line with common sense. Typically, when people feel cold, they tend to wear clothes that cover more of their body, including their arms, to help retain body heat and stay warm. Sleeveless clothes expose the arms to the cold air, which would make a person feel colder rather than warmer. Therefore, it is more common for people to wear sleeveless clothes in warmer weather when they want to stay cool. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 2913, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"People wearing a swimsuit are going to the movie theater.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"People wearing a swimsuit are going to the movie theater\" is not common sense because typically, swimsuits are worn for activities involving water, such as swimming at a pool or beach. Movie theaters are indoor environments where casual or street clothing is the norm. It would be unusual and not practical for people to wear swimsuits to a movie theater as it does not align with the typical dress code or setting. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 2914, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"People wearing a swimsuit wear it to the grocery store during their grocery day shopping.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement that people wearing a swimsuit wear it to the grocery store during their grocery day shopping is not reflective of common sense. Commonly, swimsuits are attire meant for swimming or activities at the beach or pool, not for running errands such as grocery shopping. Typically, people wear more conventional clothing that adheres to public decency standards and store policies when going to places like grocery stores. Therefore, it is not common practice or sensible for someone to wear a swimsuit for such activities. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 2915, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"People who are good at math and very logical are not artistic.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"People who are good at math and very logical are not artistic\" is a stereotype and not necessarily true. People can possess skills in multiple areas, including both logical-mathematical and artistic domains. Many individuals who excel in math and logic may also have strong artistic abilities, and vice versa. The idea that one type of skill precludes another is an oversimplification and does not account for the complexity of human abilities and interests. Therefore, the statement does not reflect common sense as it relies on a false dichotomy. \n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 2916, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"People who are not fully vaccinated should still continue to wear masks.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that unvaccinated individuals should continue wearing masks to mitigate the spread of infectious diseases, such as COVID-19. Vaccines are known to provide a significant level of immunity, reducing the risk of severe illness, hospitalization, and transmission. Unvaccinated individuals lack this protective barrier, and thus, face a higher risk of contracting and transmitting the virus. Masks serve as a physical barrier that can help prevent respiratory droplets from traveling through the air and infecting others. Therefore, wearing masks can be an effective measure for unvaccinated individuals to protect themselves and others, especially in areas with high transmission rates or when social distancing is not feasible. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2917, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"People who cannot use guns safely should not be able to purchase guns.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"People who cannot use guns safely should not be able to purchase guns\" is based on the principle of ensuring public safety. If a person is unable to use a gun safely, it poses a risk not only to themselves but also to others around them. Allowing such individuals to purchase guns could lead to accidents, injuries, or even fatalities. Therefore, restricting access to guns for those who lack the ability to handle them responsibly is a measure aimed at preventing potential harm. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2918, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"People who care about their health try to consume enoguh magnesium an important mineral required for over 300 metabolic reactions in human body.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement makes a logical connection between caring for one's health and consuming an essential mineral like magnesium, which is known to play a critical role in numerous metabolic reactions in the human body. This suggests that individuals who prioritize their health would naturally seek to ensure they get enough of such a vital nutrient. Given that magnesium is scientifically recognized as important for overall health and its deficiency can lead to various health issues, it seems reasonable to conclude that those concerned about their wellbeing would indeed make an effort to consume enough magnesium. Therefore, the statement aligns with a common understanding of health maintenance and nutritional needs. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2919, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"People who got on an emty train would be in no man's land.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"People who got on an empty train would be in no man's land\" appears to be a metaphorical or figurative expression rather than a literal one. \"No man's land\" typically refers to an area that is unoccupied or is under dispute between parties who leave it unoccupied due to fear or uncertainty. An empty train does not equate to being in a disputed or feared area; it simply means that the train is devoid of passengers at that moment. Therefore, the statement does not reflect a common-sense scenario as it does not align with the literal meaning of being in \"no man's land.\"\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 2920, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"People who have a great boss don't work diligently.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"People who have a great boss don't work diligently\" does not necessarily align with common sense. Generally, having a great boss can be a motivating factor for employees to work diligently. A great boss typically provides support, guidance, and encouragement, which can foster a positive work environment and inspire employees to perform their best. Additionally, a great boss recognizes and rewards hard work, which further incentivizes diligence. Therefore, the presence of a great boss is more likely to enhance employee diligence rather than diminish it.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 2921, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"People with courage and character always seem sinister to the rest.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that people who exhibit courage and character may be perceived as threatening or suspicious by others who may not share the same values or qualities. This perception could be due to a variety of reasons, such as jealousy, misunderstanding, or fear of the unknown. People with strong moral convictions and bravery might challenge the status quo or make others uncomfortable by holding them to a higher standard, leading to a perception of being sinister.\n\nHowever, whether this statement is considered common sense can vary depending on one's experiences and observations of how courageous and principled individuals are treated by society. In some cases, people with courage and character are admired and respected rather than seen as sinister. Thus, the statement may resonate with some but not necessarily be universally accepted as common sense.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 2922, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"People with different religion and belief systems are wrong.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"People with different religion and belief systems are wrong\" is not common sense because common sense suggests that there is value in respecting and understanding diverse perspectives. People have different religious and belief systems based on cultural, historical, and personal factors, and it is unreasonable to dismiss them as wrong simply because they are different. Common sense promotes coexistence and acceptance of diverse viewpoints as a way to enrich society and foster harmony. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 2923, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"People would praise john if he spoke with a forked tongue.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"People would praise John if he spoke with a forked tongue\" is not common sense because speaking with a forked tongue typically means being deceitful or dishonest, which are generally not traits that people praise. The phrase \"forked tongue\" is often used negatively to describe someone who is untrustworthy or manipulative. In most cultures and societies, honesty and trustworthiness are valued and praised, whereas deceitfulness is not. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 2924, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"People would smash their faces if they run into a brick wall.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"People would smash their faces if they run into a brick wall\" is based on the understanding that a brick wall is a solid, immovable object and running into it with enough force, particularly with one's face, would likely result in injury. It relies on basic knowledge of physics and human vulnerability. Given that the outcome described is a reasonable expectation based on common knowledge of physical impacts, it can be considered common sense. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2925, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"Perception is held to be of two kinds external and internal.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"Perception is held to be of two kinds external and internal\" suggests a distinction between how we perceive the outside world through our senses (external perception) and how we perceive our thoughts, feelings, and mental states (internal perception). This idea aligns with common psychological understanding that our perception is influenced by both sensory input from the environment and our internal cognitive processes and emotions. Recognizing this dual aspect of perception helps in understanding human behavior and cognition more comprehensively. Therefore, the statement can be seen as reflecting a common-sense understanding of how perception works.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2926, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"Perception is the only source of knowledge what is not perceived does not exist.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"Perception is the only source of knowledge what is not perceived does not exist\" suggests that reality is entirely dependent on individual perception, and anything beyond one's perception does not exist. However, this perspective overlooks the existence of phenomena that may not be directly perceivable but can still be inferred, understood, or proven through indirect means, such as scientific instruments or logical reasoning. Additionally, different individuals may perceive the same object or event differently, yet it does not negate the existence of the object or event. Therefore, while perception is a critical source of knowledge, it is not the only source, and things can exist independently of our perception of them.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 2927, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"Perfume is a mark of female identity and the final touch of her style.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement that \"Perfume is a mark of female identity and the final touch of her style\" suggests that perfume is an essential and defining aspect of a woman's identity and style. However, this perspective may not be universally true or applicable to all women. Identity and style are highly personal and subjective, and can be influenced by various factors such as cultural background, personal preferences, and individual experiences. While perfume can be an important element of style for some women, others may not use perfume at all or may not consider it a defining aspect of their identity. Furthermore, the statement could be seen as reinforcing gender stereotypes by associating perfume exclusively with female identity.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 2928, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"Perhaps the only true dignity of man is his capacity to despise himself.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"Perhaps the only true dignity of man is his capacity to despise himself\" suggests that self-criticism and self-awareness are the defining aspects of human dignity. While self-awareness and the ability to reflect on one's actions and flaws can be seen as important aspects of personal growth and moral integrity, it is not necessarily true that despising oneself is the only or ultimate expression of dignity. Dignity can also be derived from self-respect, compassion, resilience, and the ability to uphold ethical values. Therefore, the idea that the only true dignity comes from self-contempt is overly restrictive and does not encompass the broader qualities that can contribute to a dignified life.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 2929, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"Permitless handguns shouldn't be sold.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"Permitless handguns shouldn't be sold\" suggests that there should be regulatory measures such as permits in place before the sale of handguns. This is a common perspective because permitting processes typically involve background checks and other safety measures to ensure that firearms are sold responsibly and do not easily end up in the hands of individuals who may misuse them. The idea is to enhance public safety and prevent potential harm by ensuring that only qualified and responsible individuals own handguns. This aligns with common sense, as it prioritizes the well-being and safety of the general public. So the answer is yes."}

{"id": 2970, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"Prisoners may be caught again if they are able to escape.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"Prisoners may be caught again if they are able to escape\" is based on the understanding that prisoners are under surveillance and security measures are in place to prevent escapes and recapture those who do manage to get away. Law enforcement agencies typically prioritize the recapture of escaped prisoners to ensure public safety and uphold the rule of law. Therefore, it is reasonable to expect that prisoners who escape are at risk of being caught again due to the efforts of the authorities to locate and detain them. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2971, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"Progressive politics are the answers.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"Progressive politics are the answers\" reflects a particular political viewpoint and ideology. The idea of common sense is generally understood to be widely accepted principles or beliefs that require no additional proof or explanation. Progressive politics, like any political ideology, is subject to debate and disagreement, and may not be universally accepted as the definitive solution to various issues. Additionally, different individuals and societies may have varying interpretations of what constitutes \"progressive\" politics, making it difficult to claim this statement as common sense for everyone. Therefore, it is not universally regarded as common sense, as it is not a universally accepted belief.\n\nSo the answer is no."}

It encourages self-confidence and resilience, which are important qualities to cultivate for personal growth and overcoming challenges. Since the message aims to boost self-esteem and motivate individuals to recognize their potential beyond self-doubt, it can be considered as promoting a positive mindset rather than stating something that is universally acknowledged or obvious. Therefore, the statement may not be categorized as common sense, as it is more of an inspirational affirmation rather than a widely accepted or self-evident truth.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 2974, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"Protections and rights for all humans are worth fighting towards.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"Protections and rights for all humans are worth fighting towards\" is based on the principle of human rights, which suggests that every individual is entitled to certain fundamental rights and freedoms simply by virtue of being human. This principle is widely accepted and forms the basis of various international agreements and national constitutions. Ensuring that all individuals have access to these rights promotes justice, equality, and dignity, which are commonly held as universal values. Additionally, protecting and upholding human rights can lead to more stable and prosperous societies, as individuals are empowered and able to contribute positively to their communities. Given the broad acceptance of the importance of human rights and the benefits they bring, the statement aligns with what many would consider common sense. So the answer is yes."}

Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"Provide no-cost health care coverage for all\" can be seen as common sense from a humanitarian and public health perspective. Ensuring that everyone has access to health care without financial barriers can lead to better overall health outcomes, prevent the spread of diseases, and reduce long-term medical costs by addressing health issues early. Access to health care is also considered a basic human right by many. However, the feasibility of implementing no-cost health care coverage depends on economic factors, government policies, and resource allocation.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}

Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that providing loans to producers can help boost the agricultural economy during a crisis by giving them the financial resources needed to continue or expand their operations. This can help stabilize production, maintain employment, and ensure food security during challenging times. Access to credit can be critical for farmers to invest in necessary inputs like seeds, fertilizers, and equipment, or to cover operational costs when revenue is disrupted. By supporting producers, the broader economy can also benefit from the stability and continuity of the agricultural sector.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2977, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"Providing farmers and ranchers with new market opportunities will help the local economy grow.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement that providing farmers and ranchers with new market opportunities will help the local economy grow is based on the idea that increasing market access can lead to increased sales and revenue for agricultural producers.

These partnerships can help leverage private sector expertise, increase efficiency, and provide additional funding sources for public projects. However, the success of PPPs can vary depending on the nature of the project, the alignment of interests between public and private entities, and the management of the partnership.\n\nWhile PPPs can be a valuable tool for addressing public needs, they are not a one-size-fits-all solution and may not always be the most appropriate mechanism for every situation. It is important for Congress to carefully consider the specific circumstances and potential impacts of adopting PPPs as a more prominent strategy.\n\nSo the answer is no."}

{"id": 2981, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"Pure concepts are not derived from experience.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"Pure concepts are not derived from experience\" suggests that there are certain concepts that exist independently of our sensory experiences, and are innate or a priori in nature. This idea aligns with the philosophical perspective of rationalism, which posits that knowledge or concepts can be gained through reason alone, without the need for sensory experience. Common sense, however, often relies on empirical evidence and experiences that we gather through our senses. For most people, understanding and knowledge come from interacting with the world, observing, and learning from those observations. Therefore, the statement might not align with what is typically considered common sense, which is more grounded in practical and experiential understanding. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 2982, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"Pure love and suspicion cannot dwell together at the door where the latter enters the former makes its exit.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that pure love and suspicion are incompatible emotions that cannot coexist in a relationship. Pure love is characterized by trust, openness, and acceptance, while suspicion involves doubt, mistrust, and skepticism. When suspicion enters a relationship, it undermines the foundation of trust that pure love is built upon, leading to insecurity and potentially causing pure love to diminish or disappear.\n\nThe idea that love and suspicion are incompatible is supported by the notion that healthy relationships are built on trust and mutual respect. Suspicion can erode these essential components, leading to conflicts, misunderstandings, and emotional distance between partners.\n\nOverall, the statement reflects a common understanding of how emotions like trust and suspicion can impact the dynamics of a relationship. Therefore, it aligns with common sense that love and suspicion are opposing forces that struggle to coexist.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}

Therefore, the desire to repair an umbrella in anticipation of or during rain is a practical and reasonable response.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2985, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"Ranjan does not care about the public.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "To evaluate whether the statement \"Ranjan does not care about the public\" is common sense, it is important to consider the evidence or context provided for Ranjan's attitudes or actions towards the public. Common sense typically involves judgments or assumptions that are widely held based on shared experiences or general knowledge. Without specific information about Ranjan's behavior or statements regarding the public, it is difficult to determine if this is a common sense assertion.\n\nMaking a claim about someone's level of care or concern without evidence can lead to unfair assumptions and may not represent a common sense approach. Common sense would require more concrete information to make a reasonable assessment of Ranjan's attitude towards the public.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 2986, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"Read more here download and post this social media shareable.\" Do you think this statement is common sense?

Additionally, there are phenomena in the physical world that are difficult to measure accurately or are beyond current scientific understanding, yet are still considered real. Thus, reducing reality solely to what can be measured oversimplifies the complexity of existence.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 2989, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"Really religious people tend to talk about their faith a lot.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"Really religious people tend to talk about their faith a lot\" is based on the idea that those who are deeply committed to their faith are likely to be more vocal about it. This is because religion often plays a central role in their lives, influencing their values, decisions, and daily activities. As a result, religious individuals may talk about their faith as a way to share their beliefs, connect with others who share similar views, or even evangelize.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that the frequency and context in which people talk about their faith can vary widely depending on individual personalities, cultural norms, and the social environment. Some deeply religious people may choose to express their faith more privately or through actions rather than words.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}

{"id": 2992, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"Region wide lockdowns do not make sense when the pandemic is not severe.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"Region wide lockdowns do not make sense when the pandemic is not severe\" suggests that the implementation of strict measures such as lockdowns should be proportionate to the level of threat posed by the pandemic. When the pandemic is not severe, less restrictive measures might be sufficient to control the spread of the disease while minimizing disruption to daily life and economic activities. Lockdowns can have significant economic, social, and psychological impacts, so it is important to balance public health concerns with these other factors. If the threat level is low, localized or targeted interventions might be more appropriate and effective than a region-wide lockdown. Therefore, the statement reflects a practical approach to managing public health crises based on the severity of the situation. \n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2993, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"Regretting the past is like chasing after the wind.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"Regretting the past is like chasing after the wind\" suggests that dwelling on past mistakes or missed opportunities is futile and unproductive, much like trying to catch something as elusive as the wind. This analogy highlights the idea that the past cannot be changed, and excessive focus on it can prevent one from moving forward and making positive changes in the present and future. Since it promotes the practical approach of accepting past events and focusing on the present, the statement aligns with common sense. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2994, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"Regulatory work would help restore trust in medicine.\" Do you think this statement is common sense?

This idea is based on the understanding that regulations are designed to ensure safety, efficacy, and ethical standards, which are critical factors in fostering trust. When people believe that there are robust safeguards in place to protect their health and well-being, they are more likely to trust medical professionals and the treatments they provide.\n\nGiven that trust in medicine is essential for public health and effective healthcare delivery, enhancing regulatory measures can be seen as a reasonable approach to addressing concerns about medical practices and ensuring that they meet high standards. Therefore, the statement aligns with the logic that improving oversight and accountability in medicine would contribute positively to public trust.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2995, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"Religion belief systems can help guide our day to day moral characters.\" Do you think this statement is common sense?

Given these various ways in which religion can positively impact individuals, it is reasonable to say that religion can help people in different ways. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 2997, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"Religion is a person decision.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"Religion is a personal decision\" reflects the idea that individuals have the autonomy to choose their own beliefs and religious practices. This perspective aligns with the principle of freedom of religion, which is a fundamental right recognized in many societies. It suggests that religion is a matter of personal conviction and individual choice, rather than something imposed by external forces or societal expectations.\n\nFurthermore, personal experiences, cultural background, and individual reflection often play significant roles in shaping one's religious beliefs. Therefore, it makes sense to view religion as a personal decision, as it is deeply intertwined with individual identity and values.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}

Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"Religion is the opiate of the masses\" was made by Karl Marx and suggests that religion is used as a tool to pacify and distract people from their suffering and from challenging oppressive social structures. It portrays religion as a way to provide comfort and an illusion of happiness without addressing the root causes of social issues. Whether this statement is considered common sense depends on one's perspective on religion and its role in society. Some may agree with Marx's view and see religion as a means of control, while others may see religion as a genuine source of spiritual fulfillment and community support. Therefore, the perception of this statement as common sense is subjective and varies based on individual beliefs and experiences.\n\nSo the answer is no."}

It conveys the idea that the presence of a particular person is so significant in someone's life that their absence can make the world feel empty and devoid of others.

The use of the phrase \"get back on track\" implies that South Carolina was previously performing better in certain aspects and has since deviated from that path. This statement could be considered common sense if there is observable evidence or widespread agreement among residents and experts that the state is facing challenges that need addressing. However, without specific context or information on what areas need improvement, it is hard to definitively say it is common sense. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 3226, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"Speak well of your friend and do not speak of your enemy.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"Speak well of your friend and do not speak of your enemy\" reflects a principle of focusing on the positive aspects of relationships and avoiding the spread of negativity. Speaking well of friends helps to strengthen and maintain healthy relationships, and it promotes a positive atmosphere. On the other hand, speaking of enemies can perpetuate conflict, negativity, and may harm one's own reputation as someone who gossips or holds grudges.\n\nThis advice also aligns with the idea of taking the high road and not engaging in unnecessary conflicts or negative talk that could escalate situations further. By refraining from speaking about enemies, individuals can avoid exacerbating tensions and focus on more constructive and positive interactions.\n\nGiven that this statement encourages positivity and constructive behavior while discouraging negativity and conflict, it can be seen as a common-sense approach to interpersonal relationships.

Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"Speech is external thought and thought internal speech\" suggests that there is a direct correlation between speaking and thinking, where speech is simply the outward expression of our internal thoughts, and thoughts are the inward form of our external speech. This idea aligns with the common understanding that our thoughts often guide what we say, and our speech can influence our thought processes. However, it's important to recognize that thoughts can also be non-verbal and abstract, not always conforming to the structure of language. Additionally, not all thoughts are articulated through speech. Therefore, while there is a connection between speech and thought, the statement may oversimplify the complex relationship between the two. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 3228, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"Speech was given to man to disguise his thoughts.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"Speech was given to man to disguise his thoughts\" suggests that speech is used primarily as a tool for deception rather than communication. In reality, speech is a fundamental aspect of human interaction that facilitates the sharing of ideas, emotions, and information. While it is true that speech can be used to deceive, it is not its primary purpose. Speech serves to build relationships, educate, inform, and express oneself genuinely much more often than it is used to disguise true thoughts. Therefore, to say that speech was given solely to disguise thoughts is an overly cynical view that does not align with the common understanding of the role of speech in human society.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 3229, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"Sport clubs should be strict with disrespectful fans.\" Do you think this statement is common sense?

This approach can also uphold the reputation and integrity of the club and the sport in general.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 3230, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"Sport events should be held mask free to allow for no risk to athlete health.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"Sport events should be held mask free to allow for no risk to athlete health\" may initially seem to suggest that wearing masks could pose a risk to athletes' health, possibly due to concerns about breathing restrictions during high-intensity activities. However, the use of masks has been widely recommended by health organizations to reduce the transmission of respiratory viruses, such as COVID-19, especially in crowded settings.\n\nThe decision to hold sports events without masks should be based on current public health guidelines and the rates of community transmission. If the event can ensure physical distancing and other safety measures, or if athletes are regularly tested and confirmed negative, it might be safer to consider mask-free events. However, the broad statement that mask-free events categorically allow for \"no risk\" to athlete health does not take into account the potential risk of virus transmission among athletes, staff, and spectators.\n\nTherefore, the statement may overlook the benefits of mask-wearing in reducing the spread of infectious diseases and does not account for the complexities of managing athlete health and safety during a pandemic. So the answer is no."}

Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The concept that the federal government has a responsibility to look out for the interests of individual states is rooted in the principle of federalism, where power is divided between national and state governments. Each level of government has distinct and overlapping responsibilities, and the federal government is expected to consider the needs and interests of the states when making decisions that affect the entire country. This includes ensuring that policies and laws are fair and equitable, providing support during emergencies, and facilitating cooperation among states. Balancing the interests of individual states with national interests is crucial in maintaining a functional and united country.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}

It assumes that non-essential workers do not contribute significantly to the government's operations. However, the definition of \"non-essential\" can vary, and roles considered non-essential in certain contexts may still provide value in other ways, such as supporting essential workers and contributing to overall workplace productivity and morale. Additionally, during times of crisis or emergencies, the need for certain roles may shift, making previously non-essential workers essential. Therefore, it is not necessarily common sense to categorically state that the federal government should not employ many non-essential workers without a nuanced understanding of the roles and circumstances.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 3368, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"The first requisite of a civilization is that of justice that is the assurance that a law once made will not be broken in favor of an individual.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that a fundamental aspect of a civilization is the consistent and fair application of laws, without favoritism towards any individual. Justice, in this context, ensures that everyone is held to the same standards and that laws are not arbitrarily changed or disregarded to benefit certain individuals. This is crucial for maintaining order, predictability, and fairness in society, which are essential components of a functioning civilization. It establishes a foundation of trust and accountability, which are necessary for social cohesion and cooperation. Therefore, the statement aligns with common sense as it emphasizes the importance of justice and the rule of law as foundational elements of a civilized society. So the answer is yes."}

Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"The first thing you do when you advance into battle is generate some adrenaline\" suggests that adrenaline production is a conscious decision or action taken by an individual. However, adrenaline release is an involuntary physiological response controlled by the autonomic nervous system when the body perceives a threat or stressful situation, such as entering into battle. This response, known as the \"fight or flight\" response, prepares the body to react quickly and effectively to the perceived danger. Therefore, generating adrenaline is not a deliberate action one chooses to do but rather an automatic response triggered by the body's stress response system.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 3371, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"The first thing you do when you agree with someone is nod your head.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"The first thing you do when you agree with someone is nod your head\" suggests that nodding is a universal and instinctual response to agreement.

Some individuals might express agreement verbally by saying \"yes\" or \"I agree,\" while others might use different gestures based on cultural norms or personal habits. Additionally, the context of the conversation and the relationship between the individuals involved can influence how agreement is expressed. Therefore, the statement may not hold true universally or in all situations. So the answer is no."}

{"id": 3482, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"The last thing you do when you kill is go to jail.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"The last thing you do when you kill is go to jail\" is not necessarily true in all cases. There are various outcomes that could occur after someone commits a homicide. For instance, the individual might not be caught and arrested, could be acquitted in court, or could receive a different form of punishment such as the death penalty or probation. Additionally, some killings may be legally justified, such as in cases of self-defense or defense of others, and would not result in jail time.

Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"The last thing you do when you listen to the radio is turning off the radio\" is based on the assumption that the act of listening to the radio concludes with the user actively turning off the device. This is a logical sequence of actions as one typically stops the radio from playing when they are finished listening in order to conserve power and prevent unnecessary noise. Therefore, it can be considered common sense that the final action in the process of listening to the radio would be to turn it off. So the answer is yes."}

Laws can aim to provide equal opportunities and prevent discrimination, but they cannot alter the intrinsic qualities that make each person unique. For example, laws can ensure equal access to education, but they cannot ensure that every individual will achieve the same academic success, as personal capabilities and interests vary. Thus, while laws can promote equality in terms of rights and opportunities, they cannot completely level the playing field in terms of natural abilities and outcomes.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}

This enables more meaningful discussions and interpretations of the data, rather than getting bogged down in explaining how to read the visualization. Therefore, the statement highlights the goal of maximizing the communicative power of visualizations to enhance understanding and engagement with the ideas being presented.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}

People with liberal or progressive values, for example, may disagree with the statement and believe that conservative values do not align with their vision for the lowcountry. As common sense typically refers to ideas or beliefs that are widely held or easily understood by most people, this statement does not meet that criterion as it is specific to a particular political ideology.\n\nSo the answer is no."}

However, it's important to note that while simple answers may be appealing, they are not always the most effective or realistic solutions to complex problems. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 3561, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"The people who make art their business are mostly impostors.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"The people who make art their business are mostly impostors\" is a sweeping generalization that does not take into account the diverse motivations and genuine passion many artists have for their craft. Many individuals involved in the art industry are sincere in their efforts, whether they are creating, curating, or selling art. They pursue art as a business not just for financial gain but also out of a deep appreciation for artistic expression and creativity. While there may be some individuals who exploit the art industry, it is unfair and inaccurate to label the majority as impostors. \n\nSo the answer is no."}

Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"The quality of your life depends largely on the circumstances you were born into\" suggests that factors such as socioeconomic status, family background, and geographic location at birth significantly influence an individual's opportunities and overall quality of life. Research and empirical evidence support the idea that these initial conditions can affect access to education, healthcare, and other resources that contribute to well-being and success. However, it's also important to recognize that individual choices, efforts, and external opportunities can play a crucial role in shaping one's life trajectory, allowing for social mobility and changes in quality of life regardless of initial circumstances.

Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"The strongest man in the world is he who stands alone\" suggests that true strength is found in independence and self-reliance. However, human beings are inherently social creatures who thrive on connection, collaboration, and support from others. While self-reliance is an important trait, the ability to seek help, work in teams, and maintain relationships is also a sign of emotional and social strength. Additionally, different situations may require different types of strength, and the ability to adapt and lean on others can be a valuable asset.

While the specific teachings and interpretations may vary, the overarching moral principles tend to align on discouraging certain negative actions. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that some actions are universally discouraged by all religions based on shared ethical foundations.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 3642, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"There are some who speak well and write badly for the place and the audience warm them and draw from their minds more than they think of without that warmth.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that certain individuals perform better in speaking than in writing because the immediate presence of an audience provides a stimulating environment that enhances their communication. Speaking in front of an audience can indeed evoke a different cognitive and emotional response compared to writing in solitude. When speaking, the immediate feedback and interaction can boost confidence and facilitate clearer expression of thoughts, which might not come as easily when writing alone. This observation about human behavior and the influence of environmental factors on performance is something that can be relatable and observable in everyday life.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 3643, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"There are things that should be done to effectively deal with gun violence.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"There are things that should be done to effectively deal with gun violence\" is based on the understanding that gun violence is a significant societal issue that requires action to mitigate its impact. With the prevalence of gun-related incidents and the associated harm to individuals and communities, it is logical to assert that measures should be taken to address and reduce gun violence. This can include implementing stricter gun control laws, increasing mental health support, and enhancing community safety programs. Given the widespread recognition of the consequences of gun violence and the need for preventative measures, this statement aligns with common sense. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 3644, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"There are too many guns in the hands of americans today.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The perception of whether there are \"too many guns\" in the hands of Americans today is subjective and can vary depending on individual beliefs, experiences, and interpretations of the Second Amendment. Some may argue that the high number of guns contributes to increased gun violence and accidents, suggesting that reducing the number of guns could enhance public safety. Others may contend that the right to bear arms is fundamental for self-defense and protection against tyranny, and that responsible gun ownership is not inherently problematic.\n\nThe assessment of the statement also depends on the interpretation of \"too many.\" For some, any reduction in gun-related incidents could justify tighter gun control, while others might see widespread gun ownership as a deterrent to crime and essential to personal liberty.\n\nUltimately, whether the statement aligns with common sense depends on one's perspective on gun rights, public safety, and constitutional interpretation. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 3645, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"There are ways to regulate the police that will save lives and will be successful.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"There are ways to regulate the police that will save lives and will be successful\" can be seen as common sense because it acknowledges the potential for improvement in law enforcement practices that could lead to better outcomes. Effective regulation, such as implementing better training, oversight, and accountability measures, has been shown in various contexts to enhance the performance of police forces and reduce incidents of excessive force or misconduct. These changes, in turn, can contribute to saving lives by preventing unnecessary or unjust harm to citizens. Given the evidence-based potential for positive outcomes through regulation, it is reasonable to consider the statement as aligning with common sense. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 3646, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"There are ways to stop gun violence and we need to take action.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"There are ways to stop gun violence and we need to take action\" is based on the understanding that gun violence is a significant societal issue that requires intervention. Many believe that through a combination of legislative measures, community initiatives, and public education, it is possible to reduce the incidence of gun violence. Given the impact of gun violence on public safety and well-being, taking action to address it is seen as a logical and necessary step. Therefore, the statement can be considered common sense as it aligns with the goal of promoting safety and security within communities. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 3647, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"There can't be a different god for every so called religon.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"There can't be a different god for every so-called religion\" is subjective and depends on individual beliefs and perspectives. From a theological perspective, some may argue that there is only one true God, and different religions are simply different interpretations or understandings of the same divine entity. Others may believe in the existence of multiple gods, each specific to different religions, as seen in polytheistic belief systems.\n\nPhilosophically, the concept of God or gods can vary significantly among different cultures and religions, suggesting that the existence and nature of a divine being are not universally agreed upon. Therefore, the statement may not necessarily be considered common sense, as it dismisses the plurality of religious beliefs and the possibility of multiple gods.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 3648, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"There is a big ocean out there.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"There is a big ocean out there\" can be considered common sense because it is a widely known fact that oceans cover a large portion of the Earth's surface. Most people are aware that there are several vast oceans in the world, such as the Pacific, Atlantic, Indian, Southern, and Arctic Oceans. These bodies of water are commonly recognized for their size and significance to the planet. Therefore, the statement is a general acknowledgment of this well-known fact. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 3649, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"There is a greater power in this world.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"There is a greater power in this world\" can be interpreted in various ways, such as a religious or spiritual belief in a higher being, or a recognition of powerful natural forces or systems that govern the world. Whether this statement is considered common sense largely depends on individual beliefs, cultural background, and personal experiences. For some, the belief in a higher power or greater forces is a fundamental part of their worldview and is accepted without question, making it common sense to them. For others who may be more skeptical or have different beliefs, this statement may not be seen as common sense. Since common sense can vary widely among individuals and cultures, it is not universally agreed upon as common sense. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 3650, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"There is a panel to deal with legal barriers for airbnb to operate in our cities and towns.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests the existence of a panel specifically addressing legal barriers for Airbnb to operate in cities and towns. This is plausible because Airbnb, as a short-term rental platform, often faces regulatory challenges and legal restrictions in various municipalities. Setting up a panel to navigate and resolve these issues would be a logical step for ensuring smooth operations and compliance with local laws. Therefore, it makes sense that such a panel could exist to facilitate Airbnb's integration into different communities while addressing legal concerns.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 3651, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"There is a path to the top of even the highest mountain.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"There is a path to the top of even the highest mountain\" can be interpreted both literally and metaphorically. Literally, it suggests that every mountain, no matter how tall, has a route that can be taken to reach the summit. This is largely true as mountaineers often find or create paths to climb the highest peaks, such as Mount Everest. Metaphorically, the statement implies that no challenge is insurmountable, and there is always a way to overcome obstacles, which is a common motivational or inspirational sentiment. Given that the statement holds true in both interpretations and aligns with general understanding and beliefs about overcoming challenges, it can be considered common sense. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 3652, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"There is light in the sky.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"There is light in the sky\" can be considered common sense during the daytime when the sun is out, as it is a natural and observable phenomenon that most people are aware of. The presence of the sun provides light that is visible in the sky. However, at night, the sky is generally darker, and the statement might not hold true unless there is moonlight or artificial light. But since the statement is generally true during daytime hours when most people are active and observing their surroundings, it can be considered common sense. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 3653, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"There is little that can withstand a man who can conquer himself.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that self-mastery and self-discipline are powerful tools that can enable a person to overcome external challenges and obstacles. By conquering one's own weaknesses, fears, and limitations, an individual gains strength and resilience, making them better equipped to handle various situations in life. This idea aligns with many philosophical and psychological principles that emphasize the importance of self-control and personal development. It is a widely accepted notion that self-discipline is a key component of success and fulfillment. Therefore, the statement can be seen as common sense as it reflects a fundamental principle of human behavior and personal growth. \n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 3654, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"There is never a good reason for arguing.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"There is never a good reason for arguing\" may seem like common sense on the surface, as arguing is often associated with negative emotions and outcomes. However, arguing can also serve a positive purpose, such as clarifying misunderstandings, resolving conflicts, and promoting critical thinking. It can be a means of standing up for one's beliefs or rights and can lead to productive discussions that result in better understanding and solutions. Therefore, the statement may be too absolute in dismissing the potential benefits of arguing.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 3655, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"There is never jealousy where there is not strong regard.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "Jealousy often arises from a sense of insecurity or fear of losing something valuable to another person. In relationships where there is strong regard or deep affection, individuals may feel more vulnerable to losing the connection they cherish, which can lead to feelings of jealousy. Conversely, in relationships where there is little to no emotional investment, there is less at stake, and thus, less likelihood for jealousy. Therefore, the presence of jealousy can indeed indicate that there is a strong regard or care for someone or something. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 3656, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"There is no death it is only a change of worlds.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"There is no death it is only a change of worlds\" is a philosophical or spiritual perspective rather than a scientifically proven fact. It suggests a belief in an afterlife or a continuation of existence in a different form or realm. This idea is commonly associated with various religious and spiritual beliefs around the world, but it is not universally accepted or considered common sense. Common sense typically refers to practical and sound judgment based on observable facts and experiences in the physical world. Since the idea of life after death or changing worlds cannot be empirically verified or observed, it is not considered common sense. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 3657, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"There is no direct causation of stricter gun laws on lesser violent crime.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"There is no direct causation of stricter gun laws on lesser violent crime\" suggests that implementing stricter gun laws does not necessarily result in a decrease in violent crime. This topic is complex and involves multiple factors, including cultural, social, and economic elements that contribute to crime rates. While stricter gun laws may contribute to a decrease in gun-related crimes specifically, they may not address other forms of violent crime or underlying issues that lead to criminal behavior. Therefore, it is not definitive or common sense to assume a direct causation between stricter gun laws and a decrease in overall violent crime without considering other influencing factors. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 3658, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"There is no duty more obligatory than the repayment of kindness.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that repaying kindness is the most important moral obligation one has. This idea is rooted in the principle of reciprocity, which is a fundamental aspect of human social interaction and ethical behavior. Reciprocity involves responding to positive actions with other positive actions, thereby creating a cycle of goodwill and mutual benefit. Many cultures and ethical systems emphasize the importance of gratitude and returning kindness, as it helps maintain social bonds and promotes a cooperative society.\n\nFurthermore, the act of repaying kindness not only acknowledges the efforts of the benefactor but also encourages continual acts of generosity and compassion within a community. If kindness were regularly ignored or not reciprocated, it could lead to a decrease in altruistic behavior, which is vital for the well-being of society.\n\nHowever, whether this is the \"most obligatory\" duty can be subjective and dependent on cultural, personal, and situational factors. Different ethical systems might prioritize other duties, such as truth-telling or justice, above the repayment of kindness. Nonetheless, the general importance of acknowledging and reciprocating kindness is widely recognized.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 3659, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"There is no fun in doing nothing when you have nothing to do.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"There is no fun in doing nothing when you have nothing to do\" suggests that being idle without any tasks or activities can lead to boredom or lack of enjoyment. Common sense indicates that engagement in activities or having a purpose generally brings satisfaction and pleasure. In contrast, having nothing to occupy oneself with can often result in feeling unfulfilled or restless. Therefore, the statement aligns with the general understanding that meaningful engagement leads to enjoyment.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 3660, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"There is no greatness where there is not simplicity.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"There is no greatness where there is not simplicity\" suggests that true greatness is achieved through simplicity rather than complexity. This can be interpreted as meaning that greatness is often found in clear, straightforward, and uncomplicated ideas, actions, or solutions. This could be considered common sense because in many cases, simpler solutions are more effective, easier to understand, and easier to implement. Additionally, simplicity can lead to elegance and focus, which are often characteristics of great achievements.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 3661, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"There is no reason to have to shut down the state.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"There is no reason to have to shut down the state\" can be considered a matter of opinion and may not necessarily reflect common sense. The appropriateness of a state shutdown can depend on various factors, such as public health crises, natural disasters, or security threats. In situations where there is a significant risk to public safety or well-being, shutting down the state might be a necessary and reasonable measure to protect citizens and manage the situation effectively.\n\nWithout context, it is difficult to assess whether the statement is based on common sense. Common sense would typically involve a practical and prudent approach based on the specific circumstances at hand. If the statement ignores clear and present dangers that justify a shutdown, it may not align with common sense. Conversely, if there truly are no valid reasons for a shutdown, the statement could be sensible.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 3662, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"There is no sterner moralist than pleasure.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"There is no sterner moralist than pleasure\" implies that pleasure itself acts as a strict moral guide, perhaps suggesting that the pursuit of pleasure can teach us about the boundaries of morality and the consequences of overindulgence. When individuals experience pleasure, they may also face the negative outcomes that result from excessive indulgence, such as guilt, regret, or harm. In this sense, pleasure can serve as a teacher, illustrating the importance of moderation and the potential pitfalls of hedonism. This interpretation aligns with the idea that pleasure, while enjoyable, can also instruct individuals on the importance of ethical behavior and self-control.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that pleasure itself does not inherently possess moral qualities; rather, it is the individual's response to pleasure and the lessons they derive from their experiences that contribute to their understanding of morality. The statement may not be immediately apparent as common sense, as it requires a deeper reflection on the relationship between pleasure and morality.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 3663, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"There is no such thing as a failed experiment only experiments with unexpected outcomes.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement underscores the idea that experiments are meant to test hypotheses and gather data, regardless of whether the results align with initial predictions. In scientific inquiry, unexpected outcomes can provide valuable insights and lead to new discoveries or further experimentation. Therefore, labeling an experiment as \"failed\" simply because it did not yield anticipated results overlooks the inherent value of the knowledge gained through the process. This perspective encourages a growth mindset and resilience in scientific research.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 3664, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"There is not a passion so strongly rooted in the human heart as envy.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that envy is the most pervasive emotion among humans. Envy is defined as a feeling of discontented or resentful longing aroused by someone else's possessions, qualities, or luck. While it is true that envy is a common emotion experienced by many people at different points in their lives, stating that it is the most strongly rooted passion might be an overgeneralization. Humans experience a wide range of emotions and passions such as love, fear, ambition, and joy, which can be equally or more influential in their lives. Additionally, the intensity and prevalence of emotions can vary greatly from person to person depending on individual experiences, values, and circumstances.\n\nGiven the complexity of human emotions and the varying impact of different passions on individuals, it is difficult to definitively claim that envy is the strongest passion universally. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 3665, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"There is nothing more mysterious than clarity.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"There is nothing more mysterious than clarity\" suggests that even when something appears to be clear and straightforward, there may still be underlying complexities or hidden depths that are not immediately apparent. This idea challenges the typical assumption that clarity equates to simplicity and full understanding. Thus, the statement encourages deeper reflection and critical thinking about what may lie beneath the surface of seemingly clear situations or concepts. It implies that true clarity is rare and often more enigmatic than it seems.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 3666, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"There is nothing more tragic in life than the utter impossibility of changing what you have done.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement highlights the irreversible nature of actions and their consequences, suggesting that it is tragic when one cannot undo or alter past deeds. This sentiment resonates with the common understanding that actions have consequences, and once something is done, it cannot be undone. This can lead to feelings of regret or remorse when the consequences are negative or unintended. The idea that we must live with the outcomes of our actions is a widely acknowledged aspect of life, emphasizing the importance of thoughtful decision-making. \n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 3667, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"There is nothing so unready as readiness of wit.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"There is nothing so unready as readiness of wit\" suggests that being quick-witted or having a sharp mind does not always equate to being prepared or well-thought-out. It implies that sometimes, quick responses or clever remarks may lack depth, thoroughness, or proper consideration. In some cases, relying too much on wit can lead to overlooking important details or making hasty decisions without fully understanding the situation.\n\nThis perspective aligns with the idea that careful planning and thoughtful consideration are crucial for true preparedness, as opposed to simply having a quick or clever response. Therefore, the statement can be seen as a reminder of the limitations of relying solely on wit for readiness.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 3668, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"There is nothing that is in the universe that is not of god.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"There is nothing that is in the universe that is not of god\" is a philosophical and theological assertion that suggests everything in the universe is inherently connected to or derived from a divine source. This idea aligns with certain religious and spiritual beliefs that view the universe as a creation of a higher power or god, and thus everything within it as a manifestation of that power.\n\nHowever, whether this statement is considered common sense depends on individual belief systems and worldview. For those who adhere to monotheistic religions that posit an omnipotent and omnipresent god, such as Christianity, Islam, or Judaism, this statement may resonate as common sense because it aligns with their understanding of god's relationship with the universe. On the other hand, for individuals who are atheists, agnostic, or subscribe to belief systems that do not include a singular divine entity, this statement may not be considered common sense.\n\nIn conclusion, the perception of this statement as common sense is subjective and varies based on personal beliefs and cultural influences. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 3669, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"There is nowhere on earth that does not experience gravity.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "Gravity is a fundamental force that acts on all objects with mass and is responsible for keeping objects anchored to the Earth. It is a universal force that exists everywhere on Earth, ensuring that objects remain grounded and do not float away. Gravity's effects are felt universally, regardless of location, as it is an inherent property of the Earth's mass that attracts other objects toward its center. Based on this understanding, it is clear that every location on Earth experiences the force of gravity.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 3670, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"There is only one defined answer with mathematics.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"There is only one defined answer with mathematics\" is not always true because mathematics is a diverse field with various branches and problems that can have multiple valid solutions, interpretations, or approaches. For example, in algebra, an equation can have multiple solutions, and in geometry, there can be various ways to prove a theorem. Additionally, in applied mathematics, different models or methods can be used to solve real-world problems, leading to different but equally valid results.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 3671, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"There is only one success to be able to spend your life in your own way.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"There is only one success to be able to spend your life in your own way\" suggests that success is defined by personal autonomy and the ability to make individual choices. This perspective on success aligns with the idea that true fulfillment comes from living life according to one's own values and desires, rather than societal expectations or external measures of achievement. \n\nHowever, the notion of success can be subjective and varies greatly among individuals. For some, success may be closely tied to professional accomplishments, financial stability, or making a significant impact on society. Others may prioritize personal relationships, spiritual growth, or creative expression.\n\nGiven that the definition of success is diverse and personal, it may not be universally applicable to consider the ability to live life on one's own terms as the sole measure of success. Each individual may have different criteria for what constitutes success based on their unique goals, values, and circumstances.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 3672, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"There is only one thing more painful than learning from experience and that is not learning from experience.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement highlights the importance of learning from one's experiences, suggesting that failing to learn from past mistakes can lead to more pain and suffering in the future. This idea is based on the common understanding that learning from experience allows individuals to avoid repeating the same errors, thus preventing further negative consequences. Additionally, the process of learning and growing from experiences is a fundamental aspect of human development. Therefore, the statement reflects a widely accepted belief about the value of experiential learning and the consequences of ignoring life's lessons. \n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 3673, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"There is only one way to achieve happiness on this terrestrial ball and that is to have either a clear conscience or none at all.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that having a clear conscience, or being free from guilt or moral wrongdoing, is key to achieving happiness. Alternatively, it suggests that having no conscience at all, meaning being indifferent to moral considerations, could also lead to happiness. The idea of a clear conscience leading to happiness aligns with common ethical beliefs that acting morally and ethically brings peace of mind and satisfaction. However, the notion that having no conscience at all could also lead to happiness is more controversial and less aligned with common moral beliefs. Generally, a lack of conscience is associated with negative traits such as psychopathy or amorality, which are not typically linked to genuine happiness. Therefore, while part of the statement aligns with common sense regarding the role of a clear conscience in achieving happiness, the inclusion of having no conscience as an equally viable path to happiness is less aligned with common sense. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 3674, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"There is only one way to happiness and that is to cease worrying about things which are beyond the power of our will.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that the key to happiness is to focus on what we can control and let go of concerns about things outside of our control. This perspective aligns with various philosophical and psychological principles, such as Stoicism and cognitive-behavioral therapy, which emphasize the importance of managing our reactions to external events rather than the events themselves. By not worrying about things beyond our power, we can reduce unnecessary stress and anxiety, leading to a more content and fulfilling life. Therefore, the idea that ceasing to worry about uncontrollable factors can contribute to happiness does have a basis in common sense, as it encourages a practical and proactive approach to emotional well-being. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 3675, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"There is probability that he or she will not make sound practical judgment concerning the situation or the matters or a basic ability to perceive understand and judge that is shared the person who has common sense is in touch with common sense ideas which emerge from the lived experiences of those commonsensical enough to perceive them.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement provided seems to be convoluted and difficult to understand due to its complex structure and lack of clarity. Common sense is typically characterized by clear, practical, and straightforward thinking that is easily comprehensible. The statement does not fulfill these criteria as it is not easily accessible or understandable, which goes against the essence of common sense. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 3676, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"There is this important difference between love and friendship while the former delights in extremes and opposites the latter demands equalities.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that love thrives on differences and opposites, while friendship requires similarities and equalities. This idea can be seen in the common notion that romantic relationships often involve attraction to qualities that one may not possess themselves, fostering a sense of complementarity and balance. On the other hand, friendships are often built on common ground, shared interests, and mutual understanding, which facilitates a sense of equality and relatability.\n\nWhile the concepts presented in the statement can be observed in many relationships, it is important to acknowledge that these are not strict rules and there can be exceptions. Love can also flourish in environments where there are many similarities and shared values, and friendships can develop between people with differing views and characteristics.\n\nHowever, the general idea that love often involves attraction to opposites, and friendship to similarities, aligns with many people's experiences and observations about relationships. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 3677, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"There is war no peace in the world of the learned.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"There is war no peace in the world of the learned\" seems to suggest that among intellectuals and scholars, there is constant debate and disagreement, rather than harmony and consensus. While it is true that the academic and intellectual world often involves rigorous debates and differing opinions, it is not accurate to characterize it as a state of \"war\" with no peace. Intellectual discussions and scholarly debates are generally conducted in a respectful and constructive manner, aimed at advancing knowledge and understanding, rather than creating conflict. Therefore, it is not common sense to assume that there is no peace in the world of the learned, as the statement suggests.\n\nSo the answer is no."}

{"id": 3679, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"There probably have been more wars centering on religion than any other aspect.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement that more wars have centered on religion than any other aspect may initially seem to make sense, given the high-profile religious conflicts in history such as the Crusades, the Thirty Years' War, and various jihads. However, many wars throughout history have been driven by other factors such as territorial disputes, economic gain, nationalism, and political power. For example, World War I and World War II were primarily driven by political alliances and territorial ambitions, rather than religion. Additionally, the Cold War was influenced by ideological differences between capitalism and communism, not religious beliefs. Therefore, the statement may be an oversimplification and not accurately reflect the complex causes of wars throughout history. So the answer is no."}

{"id": 3759, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"Vice in its true light is so deformed that it shocks us at first sight and would hardly ever seduce us if it did not at first wear the mask of some virtue.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that vice, or immoral behavior, is inherently unattractive and repulsive in its true form. It implies that people are naturally inclined to be repelled by vice unless it is disguised with the appearance of virtue. This idea aligns with the common understanding that people are generally drawn to good, virtuous qualities and are averse to bad, harmful ones. The statement also highlights the deceptive nature of vice, which can make it seductive by masking itself as something commendable. This deception can be seen in various real-life scenarios where unethical actions are justified or presented as beneficial, leading people to engage in or support them without recognizing their true nature. Therefore, the statement reflects a widely observed aspect of human behavior and morality. So the answer is yes."}

This statement is a reflection on the permanence of our actions and choices, and the drastic measure of ending one's life as a means of escape or finality.

This perspective can be seen as common sense if one believes that long-time incumbents may become complacent or disconnected from the needs of their constituents. Additionally, new individuals might bring innovative solutions and be more adaptable to changing circumstances. However, experienced legislators can also offer valuable expertise and a deep understanding of the legislative process, which can be crucial for effective governance.

Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"We don't take any corporate pac money so we rely only on supporters like you\" suggests that the speaker or organization does not accept funds from corporate political action committees (PACs) and instead depends on individual donations from supporters. This assertion is logical because if an entity chooses not to accept corporate PAC money, it must find alternative sources of funding to sustain its operations or campaigns. Relying on individual supporters is a common and sensible alternative, as it allows the organization to maintain financial support without compromising its principles or independence. Therefore, the statement reflects a reasonable and strategic approach to fundraising. \n\nSo the answer is yes."}

Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that those who are in dire situations or facing extreme hardship are more likely to exhibit violence and perseverance. While it is possible that challenging circumstances can lead to increased determination and, in some cases, violent behavior as a means of survival or expression of frustration, it is not universally true. People react differently to adversity, and many may respond with resilience, peace, or other non-violent means. Additionally, labeling the wretched as more violent can be overly simplistic and stigmatizing. Therefore, the statement should not be considered common sense as it generalizes complex human behaviors without considering individual differences and external influences.\n\nSo the answer is no."}

Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"We have 4 240 left to raise today\" could be common sense in a context where a specific fundraising goal is being discussed. If it is clear from the conversation that a group or organization is trying to reach a financial target, then stating the amount left to raise would make sense. However, without additional context, the statement might not be immediately understandable, as it lacks clarity on what is being raised and why. \n\nSo the answer is no."}

If the situation indeed warrants a defensive or proactive response and collaboration is necessary, then it can be considered common sense to rally support and work together. However, without additional context about the nature of the threat or the appropriateness of \"fighting back,\" it is difficult to definitively classify the statement as common sense for all situations. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 3830, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"We have to stop her lies from getting into our homes by drowning out her ad with our ad on the air.\" Do you think this statement is common sense?

The purpose of voting by mail is to facilitate the democratic process by allowing more people to vote, regardless of their political affiliation.

Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"We must act out passion before we can feel it\" suggests that taking action can lead to the development of passion. This idea aligns with the concept that engaging in a behavior can generate the associated emotions and feelings. For example, someone may not initially feel passionate about a new hobby or project, but as they invest time and effort into it, their passion grows. This perspective is supported by psychological theories such as the self-perception theory, which posits that individuals infer their attitudes and emotions based on observing their own behavior.\n\nHowever, it's also important to consider that passion can be a driving force that motivates action in the first place. People often feel a strong passion or enthusiasm that leads them to pursue certain activities or goals. In this sense, passion can precede action.\n\nOverall, while acting out behaviors can indeed help in developing passion, it is not always necessary to act first in order to feel passion. Passion can both precede and follow action, depending on the context and individual differences. So the answer is no."}

Requiring voter identification can help verify that each voter is eligible to vote and is who they claim to be, reducing the risk of illegal votes being cast. Additionally, voter ID laws are already in place in many countries and some states in the U.S., suggesting that it is a widely accepted practice.\n\nHowever, opponents argue that voter ID laws can disproportionately affect marginalized groups, such as low-income individuals, the elderly, and racial minorities, who may have more difficulty obtaining the required identification.

Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"We shouldn't distribute stimulus checks to the extent that it overheats the economy\" suggests that there should be a balance in economic intervention to avoid excessive inflation or other negative consequences. Stimulus checks are meant to boost economic activity by increasing consumer spending, but if the economy is already operating near its capacity, injecting more money could lead to inflation. This inflation occurs when the demand for goods and services exceeds supply, leading to rising prices.\n\nConsidering the potential consequences of an overheated economy, such as reduced purchasing power and increased cost of living, it seems prudent to carefully calibrate fiscal policies like stimulus checks to match the economy's needs without pushing it beyond its sustainable limits.

Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"We shouldn't make voting by mail be a partisan issue\" is based on the idea that voting is a fundamental right and should be accessible to all eligible voters, regardless of their political affiliation. Voting by mail is a method that increases accessibility, especially for those who may be unable to vote in person due to disabilities, work schedules, or other barriers. Making it a partisan issue could lead to policies that disenfranchise certain groups of voters, which goes against the principles of democracy and equal representation. Therefore, ensuring that all eligible voters have the ability to vote by mail without partisan interference supports the integrity and inclusiveness of the electoral process.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 4173, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"We shouldn't put people in jail who don't belong in jail.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"We shouldn't put people in jail who don't belong in jail\" is based on the principle of fairness and justice.

Incarcerating individuals who do not belong in jail can lead to miscarriages of justice, harm to innocent individuals, and a lack of trust in the legal system. Therefore, the statement is rooted in preserving justice and upholding legal standards.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 4174, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"We shouldnt even think about sending our babies back into the classroom.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"We shouldn't even think about sending our babies back into the classroom\" could be seen as a reflection of concern for the safety and well-being of young children, especially in the context of a health crisis such as the COVID-19 pandemic.

However, the decision to send children back to the classroom should be based on a careful assessment of the risks and benefits, taking into consideration the local public health situation, the effectiveness of safety measures in schools, and the specific needs of the children. It is important to balance safety with the educational and social needs of children. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 4175, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"We spend our time envying people whom we wouldn't wish to be.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"We spend our time envying people whom we wouldn't wish to be\" suggests that people often feel envious of others despite not actually desiring their lives or circumstances. This could be due to the perception of others having more success, wealth, or happiness, which can be appealing from the outside but may come with its own set of challenges or sacrifices that one would not want to endure personally.\n\nOn closer examination, this envy could be superficial, stemming from a comparison based on incomplete information about the true nature of someone else's life. People often project their desires or insecurities onto others, idealizing certain aspects without understanding the full reality.\n\nTherefore, the statement underscores a common human experience of longing for what others have, while not necessarily wanting the accompanying burdens. It highlights the irony and irrationality in some forms of envy.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 4176, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"We want people who will make our country grow.\" Do you think this statement is common sense?

{"id": 4179, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"We will provide a new kind of politician.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"We will provide a new kind of politician\" is somewhat ambiguous and could be interpreted in various ways depending on the context in which it is used. It could imply a promise to bring fresh perspectives, innovative ideas, or ethical standards to the political landscape. However, without specific details on what \"new kind of politician\" means, it's difficult to assess whether this statement is grounded in common sense or is merely a political slogan.\n\nA new kind of politician could represent a positive shift if it addresses existing issues and meets the public's demands for transparency, accountability, and effectiveness in governance. However, if the statement is vague and lacks a concrete plan or definition, it may not be based on common sense but rather on an idealistic or unrealistic view of political change.\n\nIn conclusion, the statement's sensibility depends on the clarity and feasibility of what \"a new kind of politician\" entails. Since the statement itself does not provide enough information to determine its practicality, it is not inherently common sense. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 4180, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"Wearing a mask in public stops the spread of infection transmitted through respiratory droplets.\" Do you think this statement is common sense?

Scientific studies and health organizations, including the CDC and WHO, have recommended mask-wearing as an effective measure to reduce the spread of respiratory infections. This understanding is based on evidence and expert recommendations, making it a reasonable and logical practice to follow.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 4181, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"Weekend voting should be implemented across america.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"Weekend voting should be implemented across America\" can be considered common sense because it aims to increase voter turnout by making voting more accessible. Many people work during the weekdays and may find it difficult to vote on a Tuesday. By moving voting to the weekend, it may be more convenient for a larger number of people to participate in the democratic process. Additionally, many other countries have successfully implemented weekend voting which has led to higher voter participation rates. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 4182, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"Were going to protect asylum seekers.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"We're going to protect asylum seekers\" can be seen as common sense from a humanitarian perspective.

This implies that there might be problems related to water quality or availability in the region. Given that access to clean and reliable water sources is essential for the health and well-being of any community, it is reasonable to assume that support would be necessary if there are indeed issues with water in West Michigan. Additionally, the statement could also hint at broader infrastructural or environmental challenges faced by the region, further emphasizing the need for support. Since the need for clean water and adequate infrastructure is generally a fundamental requirement for any community, the statement aligns with common sense.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 4184, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"What goes up must come down.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"What goes up must come down\" is generally understood to mean that objects that are propelled upwards will eventually return to the ground due to the force of gravity. This is a basic principle of physics that is commonly observed in everyday life, such as when throwing a ball into the air or jumping. However, the statement may not hold true in certain contexts, such as objects launched into space that achieve escape velocity and do not return to Earth. Despite these exceptions, the core idea is straightforward and aligns with everyday experiences and observations of gravity's effects. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 4185, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"What you just did is really hard tonight you can go to sleep knowing you are stronger today than you were yesterday.\" Do you think this statement is common sense?

{"id": 4186, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"What you seek is seeking you.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"What you seek is seeking you\" suggests a reciprocal relationship between an individual's desires and the opportunities or outcomes that come their way. This idea aligns with the concept that focusing on specific goals or aspirations can attract corresponding opportunities or resources, often explained through the law of attraction. It implies that by actively seeking something, you are more likely to notice and seize opportunities related to that pursuit. However, whether this is common sense can vary depending on individual beliefs about how goals and desires interact with external circumstances. It may not be universally accepted as common sense because it assumes an almost mystical connection between personal intentions and external reality, which may not be evident or logical to everyone. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 4187, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"Whatever you are be a good one.\" Do you think this statement is common sense?

{"id": 4188, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"Whatever you cannot understand you cannot possess.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"Whatever you cannot understand you cannot possess\" suggests that understanding is a prerequisite for possession. This idea can be interpreted in different ways depending on the context. For example, if we consider intellectual or abstract concepts, understanding them is crucial for truly possessing the knowledge. However, in terms of physical objects, one can possess them without fully understanding how they work or their complexities.\n\nFurthermore, the idea of possession itself can vary; it can mean physical ownership, or it can mean a deeper, more comprehensive mastery or control over something. If we take the broader interpretation of possession as mastery, the statement holds more weight because true mastery of a subject or skill typically requires deep understanding.\n\nYet, in everyday practical terms, people often own or possess things without a complete understanding of them, such as technology, vehicles, or even property. Thus, while the statement might have philosophical or metaphorical validity in some contexts, it does not universally apply in a literal sense.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 4189, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"When a rule is obviously ridiculous in a particular situation then the rule should change.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"When a rule is obviously ridiculous in a particular situation then the rule should change\" suggests that rules should be adaptable and responsive to specific circumstances. Rules are generally created to provide structure, maintain order, and promote fairness. However, when a rule becomes counterproductive or causes more harm than good in a particular context, it may be sensible to reconsider or adjust the rule to better fit the situation. Adapting rules to changing circumstances can help ensure that they remain relevant, effective, and fair. Therefore, it is common sense to be open to changing a rule when it is clearly impractical or unreasonable in a specific scenario. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 4190, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"When corporation tax rates go up corporations either must lay off workers or raise the costs of their products.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that increasing corporation tax rates would leave corporations with only two options: laying off workers or raising product prices. However, this perspective might be overly simplistic. Companies have various ways to handle increased tax rates, such as optimizing operations, reducing expenses in other areas, or utilizing reserves. Additionally, the impact of tax changes can be influenced by the overall economic environment, industry-specific factors, and the financial health of the corporation. Therefore, it is not necessarily common sense to assume that the only outcomes would be layoffs or increased product costs. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 4191, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"When counting forward eight comes after seven.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"When counting forward eight comes after seven\" is based on the universally accepted sequence of numbers in the decimal numeral system, where each number increases by one.

Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"When everything is going right be prepared for something to go wrong and vice versa\" reflects the idea that life is unpredictable and subject to change. It suggests that one should remain vigilant and adaptable, as circumstances can shift unexpectedly. This perspective can be seen as common sense because it encourages a balanced mindset and preparedness, which are practical approaches to navigating the ups and downs of life. Being ready for potential challenges when things are going well, and maintaining hope when facing difficulties, are both wise strategies for personal resilience. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 4193, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"When john feels cold he often eats cold ice cream.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"When John feels cold he often eats cold ice cream\" does not align with common sense because typically when people feel cold, they seek warmth and comfort, not something that would further reduce their body temperature like cold ice cream. It would be more common for someone to consume warm food or beverages when feeling cold. Therefore, the behavior described in the statement is unusual and contrary to what one might expect based on common sense.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 4194, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"When john makes new friends he trips them every time he sees them.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"When John makes new friends he trips them every time he sees them\" does not seem to align with common sense. Common sense suggests that tripping someone is generally seen as aggressive or harmful behavior, and is not a typical or socially acceptable way to interact with friends. Making new friends usually involves building trust and positive rapport, not causing them physical harm. Therefore, tripping someone repeatedly would likely damage the friendship rather than strengthen it. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 4195, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"When john tries to enrich mary's lives he will try to make her dreams come true.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that John's intention to enrich Mary's life involves supporting her aspirations and helping her achieve her goals. This is a common understanding of what it means to enrich someone's life, as it involves contributing positively and meaningfully to their well-being and happiness. Therefore, the statement aligns with the general idea of caring for and supporting loved ones in achieving their dreams. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 4196, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"When managing others we should put aside ego and accept responsibility.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"When managing others we should put aside ego and accept responsibility\" is based on the idea that effective leadership requires humility and accountability. By putting aside ego, a manager can focus on the needs and growth of their team rather than their own self-interest. Accepting responsibility is crucial for building trust and demonstrating integrity, as it shows that a leader is willing to own up to mistakes and take corrective action. Both of these qualities are essential for fostering a positive and productive work environment. Therefore, the statement reflects foundational principles of good leadership and management practices that are widely recognized.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 4197, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"When mary feels a little cold she should put on a bathing suit.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "No, the statement does not represent common sense. When someone feels cold, the typical response is to put on warmer clothing such as a sweater or jacket, not a bathing suit which is designed for warm weather and water activities. A bathing suit provides minimal coverage and insulation, and therefore would not help in making someone feel warmer when they are already feeling cold. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 4198, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"When one door closes there's a lock being installed somewhere else.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"When one door closes there's a lock being installed somewhere else\" appears to be a metaphorical way of expressing the idea that when one opportunity is lost, a new safeguard or security measure is put in place elsewhere. It suggests that changes, whether perceived as positive or negative, can lead to new precautions or protections. It's not a literal statement, but it does convey a perspective on how changes can prompt new measures for safety or security.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 4199, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"When one half of the world experiences day the other half experiences night.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"When one half of the world experiences day the other half experiences night\" is based on the understanding of how the Earth rotates on its axis and orbits around the Sun. As the Earth rotates, the half that faces the Sun experiences daylight, while the half that faces away from the Sun experiences darkness or night. This rotation is a continuous process, which means that as the Earth turns, different regions move in and out of sunlight and darkness. This is a fundamental aspect of the Earth's daily cycle and is widely recognized and understood. Therefore, this statement reflects a basic concept of Earth's rotation and day-night cycle, which can be considered common sense.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}

Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"When people are in trouble they find a way to get out of it\" suggests that individuals have the capacity and resourcefulness to solve their problems when faced with difficulties. This notion aligns with the idea of human resilience and adaptability. In many cases, people do indeed find ways to overcome challenges through problem-solving, seeking help, or making necessary changes. However, it's important to acknowledge that this may not always be the case for everyone, as some troubles can be overwhelming or beyond one's control to resolve. Despite this, the general sentiment of the statement reflects a common belief in human perseverance and problem-solving abilities. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 4201, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"When people build a birdhouse they hang it outside.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"When people build a birdhouse they hang it outside\" is generally considered common sense because birdhouses are designed to provide shelter and nesting space for birds, which are outdoor creatures. By hanging the birdhouse outside, it allows birds to have easy access to it and use it for their intended purpose. Additionally, birdhouses are built to withstand outdoor conditions such as weather. Therefore, it makes practical sense to hang a birdhouse outside where it can serve its function for birds. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 4202, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"When people dig themselves they can fall into a hole.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"When people dig themselves they can fall into a hole\" is likely a metaphorical expression suggesting that when individuals become overly focused on themselves or their own problems, they may end up creating more difficulties for themselves. In this context, the statement serves as a warning to be cautious of self-absorption or excessive introspection, as it can lead to unintended negative consequences. It appears to convey common sense wisdom about maintaining a balanced perspective in life. So the answer is yes."}

Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"When people don't pay attention while driving they will drive into a lake\" is an exaggeration and not necessarily common sense. While it is true that distracted driving can lead to accidents, the specific scenario of driving into a lake is not a common or inevitable outcome. There are many factors that would determine the likelihood of such an event, including the driver's location, road conditions, and the type of distraction. Common sense suggests that distracted driving increases the risk of accidents in general, but does not guarantee that a car will end up in a lake. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 4204, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"When people get a ticket they put it into pocket.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"When people get a ticket they put it into pocket\" is generally based on common behavior observed in many people who receive tickets such as for a movie, concert, or parking. People often put tickets in their pockets as a convenient and secure place to keep them temporarily until they are needed for entry or proof of payment. This behavior helps in preventing the loss of the ticket and keeps it easily accessible. However, not everyone may follow this behavior as some might put their tickets in a wallet, purse, or another secure location. Despite this variation, the general idea that tickets are commonly placed in pockets aligns with typical behavior.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 4205, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"When people get back home they think they will never leave it.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that once people return home after being away, they feel a strong sense of comfort and attachment that makes them believe they will not leave again. This could be a common sentiment, as home often represents familiarity, security, and emotional connections, which can make the idea of leaving again unappealing. However, whether this statement is common sense depends on individual experiences and circumstances. Some people may feel this way, while others might have different feelings about their home or may have practical reasons that require them to leave frequently. Thus, the statement may not be universally applicable or considered common sense to everyone.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 4206, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"When people get hot they start to breath fire.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"When people get hot they start to breath fire\" is not based on common sense or scientific fact. Humans do not have the physical capability to breathe fire, regardless of their body temperature. This idea is more aligned with fantasy or mythology and does not reflect reality. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 4207, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"When people get together with friends they usually engage in fun and healthy activities.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"When people get together with friends they usually engage in fun and healthy activities\" can be considered common sense to some extent, as socializing with friends often involves enjoyable activities that can have positive effects on mental and emotional well-being. Engaging in fun activities with friends can reduce stress, increase happiness, and foster a sense of belonging. Additionally, many people choose to participate in physical activities such as sports, hiking, or dancing when spending time with friends, which can contribute to physical health.\n\nHowever, the statement may not hold true universally as the definition of \"fun and healthy activities\" can vary widely among different groups of people. Some may engage in activities that are not necessarily healthy, such as excessive consumption of alcohol or unhealthy eating. Therefore, while the statement might reflect a common scenario, it does not apply to all situations.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 4208, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"When people pound sand they eat sand.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"When people pound sand they eat sand\" does not seem to be based on common sense. Pounding sand generally refers to the act of forcefully hitting or compressing sand, typically as a way to vent frustration or to compact the sand for construction purposes. Eating sand, on the other hand, is not a typical or intentional consequence of pounding sand. In fact, eating sand could be harmful and is not a natural or logical outcome of pounding sand. Therefore, the statement does not align with common sense or logical reasoning. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 4209, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"When people take someone else's allowance they usually honestly give it back.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"When people take someone else's allowance they usually honestly give it back\" assumes that individuals generally behave honestly and responsibly when it comes to handling someone else's money. However, this might not always be the case. Taking someone else's allowance without permission can be considered theft, and it is not guaranteed that a person who engages in such behavior will return the money honestly. Factors such as personal ethics, circumstances, and consequences play a significant role in determining whether someone will return the money. Therefore, it is not common sense to assume that people will usually give back the allowance honestly after taking it without permission. \n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 4210, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"When people want to write a story they often think they can write a story without any work.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that people may underestimate the effort required to write a story, assuming it can be done effortlessly. Writing a story involves not only creativity but also planning, drafting, revising, and editing. It requires a significant amount of work to develop characters, plot, and settings, as well as to ensure coherence and proper structure. Many aspiring writers might initially think that writing a story is a simple task, but they soon realize that it involves more complexity than anticipated. Therefore, the statement reflects a common misunderstanding or misconception about the writing process. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 4211, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"When people wear pants they use belts if necessary.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"When people wear pants they use belts if necessary\" is generally considered common sense because belts are commonly used to secure pants that may be loose or ill-fitting around the waist. Belts help ensure that pants stay in place and provide comfort and functionality, especially when the pants do not fit perfectly. Using a belt when necessary is a practical solution that is widely understood and accepted. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 4212, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"When politicians focus on partisan politics rahter than issues people care about politicians' actions seem meaningless to people.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that when politicians prioritize partisan politics over the issues that matter to their constituents, their actions may appear irrelevant or disconnected from the concerns of the people they represent. This is because most people expect their elected officials to address and solve problems that directly impact their lives and communities, rather than engaging in party-based conflicts. When politicians seem more focused on scoring political points rather than solving real issues, their actions can indeed seem meaningless to the public. Therefore, the statement aligns with a reasonable expectation of how people perceive the actions of their representatives when they are perceived as being overly partisan. \n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 4213, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"When searching for something you always find it in the last place you look.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"When searching for something you always find it in the last place you look\" is often used humorously to express the idea that once an item is found, one stops searching. It is a tautology, meaning it is true by definition, since there is no reason to continue searching for an item after it has already been located. Therefore, the statement is common sense because it reflects a logical outcome of finding something. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 4214, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"When some people might take a breather others might not.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"When some people might take a breather others might not\" reflects the idea that individuals may react differently to the same situation based on their unique circumstances, preferences, or needs. It acknowledges that people have different thresholds for stress and different ways of managing it. Some might need to pause and rest, while others might continue without taking a break. This variation in human behavior is a common observation in everyday life, making the statement a reflection of a widely understood aspect of human nature.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 4215, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"When someone becomes a police officer one goes back to school for a finance degree.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"When someone becomes a police officer one goes back to school for a finance degree\" does not align with common sense as it mixes two unrelated career paths. Typically, becoming a police officer involves undergoing police academy training and learning law enforcement skills, not finance. While some officers may choose to further their education in various fields, it is not a standard or required practice to specifically pursue a finance degree upon becoming a police officer. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 4216, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"When someone borrows a car they want to take it to the store.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"When someone borrows a car they want to take it to the store\" is not necessarily common sense because borrowing a car can be for various reasons, not just for going to the store. People borrow cars for different purposes such as commuting to work, visiting friends or family, going on a road trip, or running various errands. Assuming that the sole purpose of borrowing a car is to go to the store is an oversimplification and does not consider the diversity of reasons one might need to borrow a vehicle. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 4217, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"When someone eats bread they might not be sorry about it.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"When someone eats bread they might not be sorry about it\" is common sense because eating bread is a normal and often enjoyable activity for many people. Bread is a staple food in many cultures and is not typically associated with negative consequences or regret, unless someone has specific dietary restrictions or health issues related to gluten or carbohydrates. Therefore, in general, eating bread wouldn't typically elicit feelings of regret or being sorry.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 4218, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"When someone hears a strange noise they will look for the source.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"When someone hears a strange noise they will look for the source\" is based on the natural human instinct to identify potential threats or unfamiliar stimuli in their environment. This behavior is rooted in survival instincts, as understanding the source of a noise could mean recognizing a potential danger. Additionally, curiosity also drives humans to investigate unknown sounds to gather more information about their surroundings. Therefore, it is a common and understandable reaction.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 4219, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"When someone is wearing a swimsuit they cannot play basketball.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"When someone is wearing a swimsuit they cannot play basketball\" is not necessarily true. While swimsuits are not the typical attire for playing basketball, wearing one does not physically prevent someone from playing the sport. People can still run, jump, and shoot a basketball while wearing a swimsuit. The choice of clothing might not be ideal for the sport's physical demands and movements, but it does not make it impossible to play. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 4220, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"When someone leaves a fast food store with a bag the bag will be full of food.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"When someone leaves a fast food store with a bag the bag will be full of food\" is based on the typical scenario where someone purchases food from a fast food store and receives it packed in a bag. Fast food stores are in the business of selling food, so it is logical to assume that a bag from such a store would contain food items. However, there could be exceptions such as if the bag contains only napkins, condiments, or other non-food items. Nevertheless, these cases would be less common. \n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 4221, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"When someone makes sandwiches they don't need to ask anyone else about it.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"When someone makes sandwiches they don't need to ask anyone else about it\" suggests that making sandwiches is a simple and personal task that does not typically require input or assistance from others. Generally, making a sandwich involves choosing ingredients and assembling them, which is a straightforward process that can be done independently. Additionally, preferences for sandwich ingredients are subjective, so one does not usually need to consult others when making a sandwich for themselves.\n\nHowever, there may be exceptions to this, such as when making sandwiches for a group or considering dietary restrictions or allergies of others. In these cases, asking for preferences or information may be necessary.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 4222, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"When someone takes time off they spend time relaxing and then cathcing up on work needed at home.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement reflects a common understanding of how many people utilize their time off. Generally, taking time off is associated with relaxation and a break from work-related responsibilities. However, it also provides an opportunity to catch up on personal tasks and responsibilities at home that may have been neglected due to work commitments. This balance between relaxation and productivity during time off is a common experience for many individuals.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 4223, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"When the sun rises in the morning many living things rise from their sleep with it.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"When the sun rises in the morning many living things rise from their sleep with it\" is reflective of a natural phenomenon observed in many species, including humans. This is due to the circadian rhythm, which is an internal biological clock that regulates the sleep-wake cycle in response to light and darkness. Many animals and plants have adapted to be active during the day and rest during the night, aligning their activities with the availability of sunlight. Therefore, the statement aligns with common observations about biological rhythms and behaviors in nature. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 4224, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"When the wolf is mentioned he is already near you.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"When the wolf is mentioned he is already near you\" is a proverb that suggests that when something is being talked about, it may already be present or imminent. It serves as a warning to be aware of potential dangers that may not yet be visible. This can be applied metaphorically to various situations in life where discussing a problem or threat can be an indication that it is closer to reality than one might think.\n\nHowever, in a literal sense, mentioning a wolf does not necessarily mean that a wolf is physically near. The statement is more symbolic and serves to encourage vigilance and preparedness.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 4225, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"When their lives or careers are at risk people protect their paychecks through insurance agencies.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that people take measures to safeguard their financial security when faced with potential risks to their lives or careers. Insurance is a common tool used to mitigate financial loss in the event of unforeseen circumstances, such as accidents, illnesses, or job loss. By paying premiums to insurance agencies, individuals can receive compensation or support during difficult times, which helps protect their income and financial stability. This is a practical approach to managing risk and ensuring economic security, making the statement reflective of a common-sense approach to financial planning. \n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 4226, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"When we can talk about our feelings they become less overwhelming less upsetting and less scary.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that verbalizing and sharing feelings can help alleviate their intensity and make them more manageable. This idea is supported by psychological research which indicates that talking about emotions can help individuals process and regulate them, leading to reduced stress and anxiety. Additionally, sharing feelings with others can provide social support and validation, which further aids in coping with difficult emotions. Therefore, the statement aligns with both common psychological understanding and everyday experiences where people feel relief after discussing their emotions.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 4227, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"When we cut someone else's arm that person would not call for help.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement, \"When we cut someone else's arm that person would not call for help,\" does not align with common sense. Common sense suggests that cutting someone's arm would likely cause significant pain and distress, prompting the person to call for help or seek assistance. It is a natural human response to seek aid and alert others when experiencing harm or danger. Therefore, the statement contradicts typical human behavior in such situations.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 4228, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"When we text someone else we will get annoyed if we don't hear back immediately.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"When we text someone else we will get annoyed if we don't hear back immediately\" is not necessarily common sense as it assumes a universal reaction to a common situation. People have different levels of patience and different expectations when it comes to communication response times. Some individuals may feel annoyed if they do not receive an immediate response, while others may be more understanding and recognize that the recipient may be busy or unable to respond right away. Additionally, the urgency of the message and the relationship between the sender and receiver can also influence how one feels about the response time. Therefore, it is not common sense to assume that everyone will get annoyed when they do not hear back immediately after sending a text. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 4229, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"When we turn eight years old we want to celebrate.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"When we turn eight years old we want to celebrate\" reflects a common desire to mark the occasion of a birthday, especially a milestone age like eight years old. Celebrating birthdays is a widespread cultural practice, and turning eight can be particularly exciting for children as it signifies growing older and experiencing new things. The sentiment of wanting to celebrate a birthday at this age aligns with common practices and social norms surrounding birthdays.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 4230, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"When we work together we can find solutions.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"When we work together we can find solutions\" emphasizes the value of collaboration in problem-solving. Collaboration allows for the pooling of diverse skills, knowledge, and perspectives, which can lead to more innovative and effective solutions than individuals working alone. When people work together, they can complement each other's strengths and compensate for weaknesses, making it more likely to overcome challenges and find solutions. Additionally, cooperation promotes shared understanding and consensus, which can be crucial for implementing solutions effectively.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 4231, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"When you add two numbers the resulting number is greater than either of the two that were added in the equation.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"When you add two numbers the resulting number is greater than either of the two that were added in the equation\" seems to be true when considering positive numbers. For instance, adding 3 and 5 gives 8, which is greater than either 3 or 5. However, the statement does not hold true when one or both of the numbers are zero or negative. For example, adding -2 and 1 results in -1, which is not greater than 1. Similarly, adding 0 and 5 results in 5, which is not greater than 5. Hence, the statement is not universally true because it fails in cases involving zero or negative numbers. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 4232, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"When you are rich it is hard to know who your real friends are.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"When you are rich it is hard to know who your real friends are\" suggests that wealth can attract people who are more interested in financial benefits than genuine friendship. This can make it challenging for wealthy individuals to discern who values them for their character rather than their financial status. This is a common observation and concern expressed by many who have experienced or witnessed the dynamics of relationships influenced by wealth. Therefore, it seems logical to consider this statement as an insight based on common experiences of wealthy individuals.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 4233, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"When you come to a fork in the road take it.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"When you come to a fork in the road, take it\" may initially seem nonsensical, as it appears to suggest that one should take both paths simultaneously, which is impossible. However, the statement can be seen as a humorous or philosophical remark, suggesting that regardless of the choice made, one should confidently proceed with it. In a broader sense, it can be interpreted as an encouragement to make decisions and move forward without hesitation. However, as practical, actionable advice, the statement lacks clarity and specificity, which is essential for common sense guidance. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 4234, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"When you listen it's amazing what you can learn when you act on what you've learned it's amazing what you can change.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that listening and learning can lead to impactful changes when acted upon. This concept is quite intuitive as it emphasizes the importance of being receptive to new information and using it to make informed decisions or improvements. It is a widely accepted idea that gaining knowledge and applying it can lead to positive changes in various aspects of life, whether personal or professional. Therefore, the idea presented in the statement is aligned with common sense.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 4235, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"When you say that you agree with a thing in principle you mean that you have not the slightest intention of carrying it out in practice.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests a cynicism about the sincerity of people when they claim to agree with something \"in principle.\" It implies that agreeing in principle is a way to superficially support an idea without committing to its implementation. In reality, people might say they agree with something in principle for various reasons, such as genuinely supporting the idea but recognizing practical limitations or needing more information before fully committing. While the statement captures a scenario that can occur, it is an overgeneralization to assume that this is always the case when someone agrees in principle. Therefore, it is not common sense to assume that agreeing in principle always equates to a lack of intention to follow through. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 4236, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"When you take stuff from one writer it`s plagiarism but when you take it from many writers it`s research.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that using ideas or content from multiple sources can be considered research, whereas using content from a single source is plagiarism. However, this is misleading. Plagiarism occurs when someone uses another's ideas, words, or work without proper attribution, regardless of the number of sources involved. Research, on the other hand, involves gathering information from various sources, synthesizing it, and presenting it with proper citations. Simply taking content from multiple sources without proper credit still constitutes plagiarism. Therefore, the statement oversimplifies the distinction between plagiarism and research.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 4237, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"When you travel to the arctic you need to bring warm clothing as the climate is very cold.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement is based on general knowledge about the climate of the arctic region, which is known for its extremely cold temperatures. Bringing warm clothing is a practical and necessary measure to protect oneself from the harsh weather conditions and to maintain body heat. Since this information is widely understood and recognized as a basic precaution for traveling to cold climates, it can be considered common sense. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 4238, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"When you undertake to run a revolution the difficulty is not to make it go it is to hold it in check.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that initiating a revolution is easier than controlling its direction and outcomes. This makes sense because starting a revolution often involves rallying people around a common cause or shared grievances, which can create a momentum of its own. However, once the revolution is underway, managing the diverse interests, expectations, and actions of various groups involved can be more complex and challenging. Keeping the revolution focused and preventing it from spiraling into unintended consequences or violence requires careful planning and leadership. Thus, the statement highlights the inherent difficulties in guiding a revolution towards its intended goals once it has been set into motion.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 4239, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"When you want to fool the world tell the truth.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"When you want to fool the world, tell the truth\" suggests that telling the truth can be unexpected and may catch people off guard, leading them to question the veracity of the statement. In many situations, people expect deception and manipulation, so honesty can be a surprising and disarming tactic. By telling the truth, one might be able to achieve the same outcome as deceit by playing on the skepticism of others.\n\nHowever, whether this is common sense depends on the context and the expectations of the audience. Common sense typically involves practical and sound judgment, and in some cases, honesty may not align with strategic or prudent choices if the truth could lead to negative consequences. Nevertheless, the idea that truth-telling can be a clever strategy in certain situations does align with an unconventional but practical approach to achieving one's goals.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 4240, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"When you`re arguing with a fool make sure he isn`t doing the same thing.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that arguing with a fool can be unproductive and may make you appear foolish as well. It emphasizes the importance of self-awareness and reflection during arguments, ensuring that you are not engaging in the same irrational or unproductive behavior as the other person. The statement encourages one to assess the situation and consider whether the argument is truly worthwhile or if it would be wiser to disengage. This idea aligns with the common sense notion that arguing with someone who is not open to reason can be futile and may only serve to escalate the conflict without resolution.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 4241, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"Whenever man commits a crime heaven finds a witness.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"Whenever man commits a crime heaven finds a witness\" seems to imply that there is always a higher power or cosmic force that is aware of human actions, and that no crime goes unnoticed. This idea aligns with certain religious or spiritual beliefs that suggest a divine presence overseeing human affairs. However, from a practical standpoint, not all crimes are witnessed or accounted for, and many can go unresolved or unpunished due to lack of evidence or witnesses.\n\nTherefore, while the statement may resonate with some philosophical or spiritual perspectives, it does not necessarily align with everyday practical reality where some crimes remain unobserved by others. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 4242, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"Where children are there is the golden age.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"Where children are there is the golden age\" can be interpreted as suggesting that the presence of children brings about a time of prosperity, innocence, and happiness, similar to the concept of a utopian \"golden age.\" Children often represent hope, new beginnings, and the potential for a better future. Their energy, curiosity, and playfulness can bring joy and a sense of renewal to those around them. Additionally, societies that prioritize the well-being of children often invest in education, healthcare, and safe environments, which contribute to the overall betterment of the community.\n\nHowever, the statement may not hold true in all contexts. In areas affected by poverty, conflict, or other hardships, the presence of children might not necessarily herald a \"golden age.\" The challenges faced by these communities can overshadow the positive aspects that children bring.\n\nDespite these considerations, the statement captures the idea that children can symbolize and inspire positive change and growth within a society. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 4243, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"Where large sums of money are concerned it is advisable to trust nobody.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"Where large sums of money are concerned it is advisable to trust nobody\" reflects a cautious approach to financial matters. It emphasizes the importance of being prudent and vigilant when handling substantial amounts of money to prevent potential fraud, theft, or mismanagement. Trusting no one in such situations can minimize risks and protect financial interests. However, it is also essential to recognize that complete distrust can hinder effective collaboration and relationships necessary for successful financial ventures. It is crucial to strike a balance by exercising discernment and implementing proper checks and balances. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 4244, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"Where social distancing is difficult we should wear a mask.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement is based on the principle that wearing a mask can help reduce the transmission of respiratory droplets that may contain viruses, such as the coronavirus that causes COVID-19. In situations where social distancing is difficult, such as crowded public places or close-contact environments, wearing a mask can serve as an additional protective measure to mitigate the spread of infectious diseases. Given the scientific evidence supporting the effectiveness of masks in reducing transmission, it can be considered a common-sense approach to prioritize public health and safety. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 4245, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"Where the press is free and every man able to read all is safe.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement implies that freedom of the press and universal literacy are essential for ensuring the safety and well-being of society. Freedom of the press allows for the dissemination of information, transparency, and accountability, which are crucial for a functioning democracy. When people are able to read, they can access information, educate themselves, and make informed decisions. Together, these two factors can contribute to a more informed and engaged citizenry, which can help prevent abuse of power and promote stability. Therefore, the statement suggests that these elements are foundational to a safe and secure society. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 4246, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"Where there is no imagination there is no horror.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"Where there is no imagination there is no horror\" implies that horror is a product of the mind's ability to imagine and conceptualize fear-inducing scenarios. Imagination allows us to visualize and emotionally respond to things that are not physically present or real, which is a key component in experiencing horror. If one lacks imagination, they may not be able to fully conjure or engage with ideas that evoke fear or horror, making them less susceptible to feeling horrified. Therefore, the statement suggests that imagination is a prerequisite for experiencing horror.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 4247, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"Where there is no property there is no injustice.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"Where there is no property there is no injustice\" implies that injustice arises only in relation to property or possessions. While property-related conflicts can indeed lead to injustices, such as theft or disputes over land ownership, injustice can also occur in many other forms that are not directly related to physical property. For example, injustices can occur in the form of discrimination, abuse of power, violation of human rights, and more, which are not necessarily tied to the ownership of property. Therefore, the statement overlooks these other forms of injustice that can exist independent of property relationships.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 4248, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"Where there`s marriage without love there will be love without marriage.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that if a marriage lacks love, people may seek love outside of the marital bond, possibly engaging in romantic relationships without the formal commitment of marriage. This idea reflects the human desire for emotional connection and intimacy, which, if unfulfilled within a marriage, might be pursued elsewhere. It also highlights the potential consequences of entering into a loveless marriage, which can lead to seeking fulfillment outside of it.\n\nHowever, whether this statement is considered common sense can vary based on cultural, personal, and societal beliefs about marriage and love. In some cultures, marriage is viewed more as a social or familial obligation rather than a purely romantic union, so the concept of love outside of marriage might not hold the same weight or implication. Additionally, personal values and ethics play a role in how individuals perceive love and commitment within and outside of marriage.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 4249, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"While some young adults and teens may adapt to online friendship and entertainment some may exist in boredom and loneliness during enforced isolation.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement reflects a common understanding of how different individuals may respond differently to similar situations. It acknowledges that while online platforms can provide a means of connection and entertainment for some, they may not be sufficient or fulfilling for others. This variation in experiences is a natural consequence of individual differences in personality, preferences, and circumstances. Therefore, it is reasonable to consider this statement as common sense, as it aligns with the general understanding of human behavior and the diverse ways people cope with isolation.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 4250, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"Whitmer helps people in her state.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"Whitmer helps people in her state\" refers to Governor Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan. As a governor, part of her role and responsibility is to implement policies and make decisions that benefit the residents of her state. This includes areas such as healthcare, education, infrastructure, and public safety. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that she aims to help people in her state through her actions and governance. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 4251, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"Who buys cheap pays twice.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"Who buys cheap pays twice\" suggests that purchasing low-cost items may lead to additional expenses in the long run, as they might be of inferior quality and require replacement or repair sooner than higher quality items. This can be seen as a cautionary advice to consider the long-term value and durability of a product rather than just the initial price. It emphasizes the importance of investing in quality to avoid future costs and inconveniences. This idea aligns with the principle of cost-effectiveness and the adage \"you get what you pay for,\" which are both widely recognized concepts in consumer behavior and economic decision-making. Therefore, the statement can be considered as common sense as it reflects a practical understanding of how purchasing decisions can impact overall expenses and satisfaction.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 4252, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"Whoever envies another confesses his superiority.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"Whoever envies another confesses his superiority\" implies that envy is an acknowledgment of another person's higher status, qualities, or achievements. Envy typically arises when someone perceives another individual as having something desirable that they themselves lack. This recognition, whether conscious or unconscious, can be seen as an admission that the other person possesses superior attributes or circumstances. Envy, thus, stems from a comparison in which the envier views themselves as inferior in some respect. Therefore, the statement suggests that envy is not just a feeling of desire for what someone else has, but also an indirect recognition of that person's superiority in certain aspects.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 4253, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"Whoever in discussion adduces authority uses not intellect but memory.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that relying on authority in a discussion, rather than one's own reasoning and analysis, is an indication of using memory rather than intellect. This implies that true intellectual engagement requires original thought and critical thinking, as opposed to merely recalling and repeating information or arguments presented by authoritative sources. The statement encourages independent thinking and values the ability to reason and analyze over the ability to remember and recite. While it is important to be aware of and understand authoritative sources, the statement emphasizes the value of personal intellectual contribution in discussions.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 4254, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"Why would he vote against teacher pay raises.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"Why would he vote against teacher pay raises\" suggests that the speaker finds it counterintuitive or unreasonable for someone to oppose increasing teacher salaries. Generally, it is common sense to support teacher pay raises because teachers are valuable to society, providing education and guidance to future generations. Higher pay can lead to better retention and attraction of quality teachers, which in turn benefits educational outcomes. However, there could be various reasons, such as budget constraints or differing policy priorities, that might lead someone to vote against such measures.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 4255, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"Will you help team hinson today.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"Will you help team hinson today\" is a request for assistance and does not inherently involve common sense as it is subjective and depends on the context in which it is asked. Common sense would be used to assess the situation, such as understanding who team hinson is and what kind of help is needed, but the statement itself is simply a question. Therefore, it does not directly pertain to common sense. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 4256, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"Will you stand with dr fauci and sign now.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"Will you stand with Dr. Fauci and sign now\" appears to be a call to action, likely in support of a particular initiative or stance related to public health, given Dr. Fauci's role as a prominent infectious disease expert. The sensibility of the statement depends on the context of what one is being asked to sign and whether the individual agrees with the initiative or stance being presented. Without additional context, it is difficult to assess whether the statement is common sense for everyone. However, if one trusts Dr. Fauci's expertise and agrees with the initiative, it could be considered a reasonable request.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 4257, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"Win without boasting lose without excuse.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"Win without boasting, lose without excuse\" promotes humility and accountability in both victory and defeat. Boasting after a win can be seen as arrogant and unsportsmanlike, detracting from the value of the achievement. Similarly, making excuses after a loss can prevent personal growth and learning from mistakes. Embracing this attitude encourages graciousness and maturity in handling different outcomes. It aligns with common principles of respect and fairness often emphasized in competitive and collaborative environments.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 4258, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"Winter is cold.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"Winter is cold\" is generally considered common sense because it is a widely accepted and well-known fact that winter is associated with lower temperatures in many parts of the world. This understanding is based on the Earth's axial tilt and its impact on seasonal weather patterns, leading to colder temperatures during the winter months in most temperate regions. Additionally, cultural and societal references to winter commonly emphasize cold weather, snow, and ice, reinforcing this perception. So the answer is yes."}
{"id": 4259, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"Winter is not a season it`s an occupation.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"Winter is not a season it's an occupation\" is metaphorical and not meant to be taken literally. It suggests that dealing with winter requires a substantial amount of effort, planning, and activity, similar to a job or occupation. Winter often brings challenges such as cold weather, snow, and ice, which require people to engage in activities like shoveling snow, winterizing homes, and preparing for potential emergencies. Therefore, the statement highlights the demanding nature of the season rather than describing it as a literal job. \n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 4260, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"Wisdom is like a baobab tree it is hard for an individual to embrace it.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that wisdom is vast and complex, much like the large and sturdy baobab tree, making it challenging for a single person to fully grasp or encompass it. This parallels the idea that gaining wisdom often requires a lifetime of experiences, learning, and growth, which is generally difficult to achieve alone. This metaphor emphasizes the collective effort and shared knowledge that contribute to one's understanding and wisdom, highlighting the importance of community and collaboration in personal development.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}

Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement suggests that a person with a dirty nappy has the choice to place it on the floor or hold onto it when the train gets full. From a common sense perspective, it is not considerate or hygienic to place a dirty nappy on the floor of a public space like a train, where it can create an unsanitary environment and discomfort for other passengers. Proper disposal in a designated trash receptacle or holding onto it until one can be found would be the sensible options. Therefore, the idea of putting a dirty nappy on the floor being a reasonable choice lacks common sense. So the answer is no."}
{"id": 4262, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"With all things and in all things we are all relatives.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"With all things and in all things we are all relatives\" suggests a sense of interconnectedness and interdependence among all living beings and elements of the environment.

This idea is logical because having a great idea or feeling inspired is just the starting point. To bring that idea to life and make it tangible, one requires the necessary skills, techniques, and dedication to execute it effectively. Without craftsmanship, inspiration may lack direction and substance, making it difficult to materialize into something concrete. Therefore, the statement highlights the importance of combining both inspiration and craftsmanship to achieve a successful outcome. So the answer is yes."}

{"id": 4266, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"Women's sports are sacred and need to be protected from political attacks.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"Women's sports are sacred and need to be protected from political attacks\" suggests that women's sports hold a special value and should be shielded from external influences that could undermine their integrity. Women\u2019s sports, like all sports, can indeed be a platform for empowerment, equality, and social change. However, the notion of being \"sacred\" implies an inviolability that may not always be practical, as sports do not exist in a vacuum and can be subject to the same societal and political pressures as other domains.\n\nMoreover, defining what constitutes a \"political attack\" can be subjective. While it is crucial to protect athletes from discrimination and ensure that sports remain inclusive and fair, the involvement of politics in sports can sometimes lead to positive changes, including better funding, improved governance, or heightened awareness of important social issues. Thus, blanket protection from all political influence might not always be beneficial.\n\nSo the answer is no."}
{"id": 4267, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"Won't put politics over people.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"Won't put politics over people\" emphasizes the importance of prioritizing the well-being and needs of individuals over political agendas or interests.

Common sense suggests that effective governance and leadership should be centered around the betterment of society and the people within it, rather than being clouded by political maneuvering. Therefore, prioritizing people over politics seems to be a sensible and ethical stance to adopt.\n\nSo the answer is yes."}
{"id": 4268, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"Word is a shadow of a deed.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"Word is a shadow of a deed\" suggests that actions speak louder than words, and that words are merely a reflection or indication of actions taken. This idea is rooted in the belief that tangible actions have more significance and impact compared to spoken or written words. It emphasizes the importance of backing up words with corresponding actions to give them credibility and substance. This concept is commonly understood and accepted in various cultural and social contexts, reinforcing the idea that deeds hold more weight than words alone. Therefore, it aligns with common sense as it highlights the value of actions in expressing intentions and commitments more effectively than words can. So the answer is yes."}

Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"Words are the most powerful drugs used by mankind\" speaks to the influence that language and communication have on human thoughts, emotions, and actions. Words can inspire, motivate, and uplift, but they can also hurt, manipulate, and destroy. Considering the impact that words can have on an individual's mental and emotional state, as well as their ability to shape societies and cultures, it is clear that words hold significant power.\n\nHowever, whether words are considered the \"most powerful drugs\" depends on one's interpretation of the word \"drug\" in this context. If we view \"drug\" metaphorically as something that can alter one's state of mind or behavior, then words certainly fit this description. On the other hand, if we consider \"drug\" in the literal sense of a chemical substance, then the comparison might not hold.\n\nIn conclusion, understanding the profound influence of words supports the idea that they can be seen as powerful agents, akin to drugs, in their ability to affect human beings. So the answer is yes."}

This idea of balance is widely recognized and advocated in various cultures and wellness philosophies as it promotes a healthy and sustainable lifestyle. Therefore, it aligns with common sense as it reflects a practical and universally accepted approach to living a fulfilling life. So the answer is yes."}

Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"Working out is like saving for your health 401k\" draws a parallel between investing in physical exercise and investing in a retirement savings plan. The idea is that just as contributing to a 401k helps ensure financial security in the future, regularly working out helps ensure better health outcomes as one ages. Both actions require consistent effort and discipline over time, and both yield long-term benefits that may not be immediately apparent.

{"id": 4274, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"Writing is like prostitution first you do it for love and then for a few close friends and then for money.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement draws a parallel between writing and prostitution by suggesting that both start as a passion or for personal reasons and eventually become monetized. While the comparison might be seen as controversial or provocative, the underlying idea is that motivations can shift from intrinsic to extrinsic over time. This can be true for some writers who initially write for their own enjoyment or to share with a small circle, and later pursue writing as a source of income. However, the comparison to prostitution could be seen as extreme or inappropriate by some, as it equates a creative and intellectual pursuit with a profession that is often stigmatized and fraught with ethical and legal issues. Therefore, whether this statement is considered common sense may depend on one's interpretation and tolerance for metaphorical comparisons. So the answer is no."}

Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"Wrong given red cards in soccer should be overturned\" speaks to ensuring fairness and accuracy in the sport. Red cards have significant consequences in a match, as they result in a player being sent off the field, which can drastically alter the dynamics and outcome of the game. If a red card is incorrectly issued due to a referee's mistake or misjudgment, it undermines the fairness of the competition. Utilizing available technology, such as VAR (Video Assistant Referee), to review and potentially overturn incorrect decisions helps maintain the integrity of the sport.
