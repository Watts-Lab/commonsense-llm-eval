{"id": 0, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"1 plus 1 is 2.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"1 plus 1 is 2\" is considered a fundamental axiom of arithmetic. It's so basic that we learn it very early in life.  It's not something we typically arrive at through complex reasoning or observation of the world. It's more of a foundational rule upon which we build our understanding of mathematics.  Common sense refers to generally accepted knowledge and practical judgment. \n\nSo the answer is yes. \n"}
{"id": 1, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"5 is alot bigger than 1.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"5 is a lot bigger than 1\" depends heavily on the context. In simple counting, 5 is indeed much larger than 1. However, if we're talking about the difference between 1 billion dollars and 5 billion dollars, the relative difference is less significant.  So the answer is no. \n"}
{"id": 2, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"A balanced diet and regular exercise is needed to remain healthy.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The idea that a balanced diet and regular exercise are beneficial to health is widely accepted and promoted. It's something that is taught from a young age and reinforced through various channels. While the specifics of what constitutes a \"balanced diet\" and \"regular exercise\" might vary, the underlying principle is generally understood. \n\nSo the answer is yes. \n"}
{"id": 3, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"A ball is round.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"A ball is round\" is generally considered true based on our common experiences and understanding of the word \"ball.\"  Most balls we encounter, like basketballs, soccer balls, and tennis balls, are indeed round. This shared understanding is what we often refer to as common sense. \n\nSo the answer is yes. \n"}
{"id": 4, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"A baton twirler doesn't want a broken finger.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "Broken fingers make it difficult to grip and manipulate objects, and baton twirling requires precise and agile finger movements. It's reasonable to assume someone who relies on their hands for their hobby or profession would want to avoid injury. So the answer is yes. \n"}
{"id": 5, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"A battery can't provide power forever.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"A battery can't provide power forever\" is based on a fundamental understanding of how batteries work. Batteries store a finite amount of chemical energy, and as they release this energy, their capacity to provide power diminishes. This is a widely accepted fact, taught in basic science education and reinforced through everyday experiences with devices running out of battery. \n\nSo the answer is yes. \n"}
{"id": 6, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"A bill is not wanted.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement \"A bill is not wanted\" is too general to be considered common sense. Bills can refer to invoices for goods or services, or proposed laws.  While most people don't enjoy paying bills, they are a necessary part of life. Similarly, some bills proposed in government may be unwanted by some, but necessary or even desirable for others. \n\nSo the answer is no. \n"}
{"id": 7, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"A birthday would make you want to bake a cake.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "This statement assumes a universal desire to bake cakes for birthdays. While many people enjoy cake on their birthday, it's not a universal truth that everyone would want to bake one. Some people dislike baking, some might prefer to buy a cake, and others might not celebrate with cake at all. \n\nSo the answer is no. \n"}
{"id": 8, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"A birthday would make you want to buy something for a loved one.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "The statement assumes a causal relationship between a birthday and the desire to buy a gift. While gift-giving is a common tradition associated with birthdays, it's not a universal or necessary response. Some people may prefer to celebrate in other ways, or financial constraints might prevent gift-giving.  The statement generalizes a cultural practice as an inherent truth. So the answer is no. \n"}
{"id": 9, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"A building where christians worship is called a church.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "While it's true that the word \"church\" is commonly used to describe a building where Christians worship, it's not entirely accurate to call it \"common sense\".  There are other terms used by different Christian denominations, such as \"cathedral\", \"chapel\", or \"meeting house\". Additionally, the word \"church\" can also refer to the community of believers, not just the building.  \n\nSo the answer is no. \n"}
{"id": 10, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"A cat doesn't want a bath.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "While many cats display an aversion to water and bathing, it's not inherently true that *all* cats dislike baths. Some cats tolerate or even enjoy water. Generalizing about an entire species based on observed behavior in some individuals is not a reliable form of reasoning.  So the answer is no. \n"}
{"id": 11, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"A cat doesn't want its tail pulled.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "Pulling a cat's tail would cause it pain and distress. It's generally understood that animals, including cats, don't enjoy pain.  Therefore, it's reasonable to assume a cat wouldn't want its tail pulled. So the answer is yes. \n"}
{"id": 12, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"A cat doesn't want to be wet.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "While it's generally true that cats avoid water, it's not a universal truth. Some cats enjoy water and even swim.  Attributing a specific desire to an entire species based on a general observation is an oversimplification. Common sense should be based on broadly applicable truths, not stereotypes. So the answer is no. \n"}
{"id": 13, "prompt": "Consider the statement, \"A cat doesn't want to get wet.\" Do you think this statement is common sense? Briefly explain your reasoning first, then end your answer with \"So the answer is yes.\" or \"So the answer is no.\"", "response": "While many people associate cats with a dislike of water, it's not universally true for all cats. Some breeds, like Maine Coons and Bengals, are known to enjoy water. Additionally, individual cats may have different experiences and preferences that influence their reaction to getting wet.  \n\nCommon sense should reflect widely observed truths, and the statement doesn't hold true for all cats. **So the answer is no.** \n"}
