However, over time, the term \"church\" came to be used to refer to the physical building where Christians worship. So, while the church is primarily the body of believers, it can also refer to the building where they meet."}

It is full of anger, resentment, and bitterness. A hateful heart is always looking for the worst in others and is always quick to judge. A hateful heart is also unforgiving and holds grudges. It is not interested in the well-being of others and is always looking for ways to hurt them.\n\nA hateful heart can destroy a family. It can tear family members apart and create a sense of isolation and insecurity. A hateful heart can also lead to violence and abuse.\n\nIt is important to remember that love is the only thing that can overcome hate. If you have a hateful heart, it is important to seek help.
